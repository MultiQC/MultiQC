## Special Case Templates

Add these sections when applicable:

### Missing Example Files

```markdown
### 📁 Missing Example Files

**Important:** Example files are the most critical component of a module request (+8 points).

**Please provide example files in one of these ways:**

- ✅ Drag and drop actual files from the tool into this issue
- ✅ Use `.zip` if GitHub doesn't support the file type
- ✅ Submit a PR to the [MultiQC/test-data](https://github.com/MultiQC/test-data) repository
- ✅ Link to files already in the test-data repository

**Requirements:**

- Include 2-3 representative examples (typical output)
- ❌ Do NOT copy/paste file contents (formatting and whitespace matter!)

Without example files, module development is very difficult. This is the #1 way to increase your request's priority.
```

### Tool Not Found

```markdown
### ⚠️ Tool Repository Not Found

The repository URL provided could not be accessed. This may be because:

- The repository is private
- The URL is incorrect
- The repository has been deleted

**Action needed:** Please provide a valid, public repository URL or tool homepage. This is required for assessing tool popularity and maintenance status.
```

### Related Requests

```markdown
### 🔄 Related Requests Found

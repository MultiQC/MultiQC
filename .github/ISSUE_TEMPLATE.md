<!--
Hi there!

Many thanks for creating a MultiQC issue. Most issues
fall into two categories: either you're reporting a
problem with MultiQC or you'd like a new issue.

To make sure that you include all of the information
I'll need, I've made two templates for these scenarios
below. Please try to include everything and delete
the rest of the template that is not needed.

You can also delete this entire thing and just type :)

Phil

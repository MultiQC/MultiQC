        ## üìã Module Request Guidelines

        Thank you for requesting a new MultiQC module! Your request will be automatically analyzed and prioritized based on:
        - **Tool popularity** (GitHub stars, downloads)
        - **Request quality** (completeness, example files)
        - **Community need** (reactions, comments)

        üí° **Tips for higher priority:**
        - Upload actual example files (most important!)
        - Provide complete information
        - Use a popular, actively maintained tool

        ‚ú® **Get instant feedback:** Comment `@claude analyze-module` anytime for detailed analysis!

    attributes:
      label: Tool output example files
      description: |
        **üìÅ Example files are critical for module development!**

        - Drag and drop example files showing typical tool output
        - **Do NOT copy/paste file contents** - formatting and whitespace matter
        - Use `.zip` files if GitHub doesn't support the file type
        - Include both small and representative examples
        - Truncate large files but keep enough data to show the format

        üí° **Quality examples significantly increase your request's priority!**

    id: filename-pattern
    attributes:
      label: Log filename pattern
      description: |
        Specify the filename pattern only if standardised by the tool and **NOT** specified by user. It must be consistent for all runs of tool by any user.
        Leave blank if the tool does not have a standard file naming pattern (eg. printing to standard out, or taking free text filename as a command line option).
      placeholder: eg. *_mytool.txt

    id: plots
    attributes:
      label: Data suitable for MultiQC plots
      description: |
        What data in the tool output is most important - what would you like to see in a plot or dedicated table?
        Remember that MultiQC should just highlight the important bits - enough to spot outlier samples for further examination.
      placeholder: |
        - Distribution of quality scores across reads
        - Pass/fail counts by sample
        - Summary metrics comparison

    * WGSMetrics now add the mean and standard-deviation coverage to the general stats table (hidden) ([@cpavanrun](https://github.com/cpavanrun))
* **QUAST**
    * Null values (`-`) in reports now handled properly. Bargraphs always shown despite varying thresholds. ([@vladsaveliev](https://github.com/vladsaveliev))
* **RNA-SeQC**
    * Don't create the report section for Gene Body Coverage if no data is given
* **Samtools**
    * Fixed edge case bug where MultiQC could crash if a sample had zero count coverage with idxstats.

    * Fixed bug where some samples could be given a blank sample name ([@lparsons](https://github.com/lparsons))

#### New MultiQC Features:
* Add `path_filters_exclude` to exclude certain files when running modules multiple times. You could previously only include certain files.
* New `exclude_*` keys for file search patterns
    * Have a subset of patterns to exclude otherwise detected files with, by filename or contents
* Command line options all now use mid-word hyphens (not a mix of hyphens and underscores)
    * Old underscore terms still maintained for backwards compatibility
* Flag `--view-tags` now works without requiring an "analysis directory".
* Removed Python dependency for `enum34` ([@boulund](https://github.com/boulund))
* Columns can be added to `General Stats` table for custom content/module.

* Stop prepend_dirs set in the config from getting clobbered by an unpassed CLI option ([@tsnowlan](https://github.com/tsnowlan))
* Modules running multiple times now have multiple sets of columns in the General Statistics table again, instead of overwriting one another.
* Prevent tables from clobbering sorted row orders.
* Fix linegraph and scatter plots data conversion (sporadically the incorrect `ymax` was used to drop data points) ([@cpavanrun](https://github.com/cpavanrun))

## [MultiQC v1.4](https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC/releases/tag/v1.4) - 2018-01-11

A slightly earlier-than-expected release due to a new problem with dependency packages that is breaking MultiQC installations since 2018-01-11.

#### New Modules:
* [**Sargasso**](http://statbio.github.io/Sargasso/)
    * Parses output from Sargasso - a tool to separate mixed-species RNA-seq reads according to their species of origin
    * Module written by [@hxin](https://github.com/hxin/)
* [**VerifyBAMID**](https://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/VerifyBamID)
    * Parses output from VerifyBAMID - a tool to detect contamination in BAM files.
    * Adds the `CHIPMIX` and `FREEMIX` columns to the general statistics table.
    * Module written by [@aledj2](https://github.com/aledj2/)

#### Module updates:
* **MACS2**
    * Updated to work with output from older versions of MACS2 by [@avilella](https://github.com/avilella/)
* **Peddy**
    * Add het check plot to suggest potential contamination by [@aledj2](https://github.com/aledj2)
* **Picard**
    * Picard HsMetrics `HS_PENALTY` plot now has correct axis labels
    * InsertSizeMetrics switches commas for points if it can't convert floats. Should help some european users.
* **QoRTs**
    * Added support for new style of output generated in the v1.3.0 release
* **Qualimap**
    * New `Error rate` column in General Statistics table, added by [@Cashalow](https://github.com/Cashalow/)
        * Hidden by default - customise your MultiQC config to always show this column (see [docs](http://multiqc.info/docs/#hiding-columns))
* **QUAST**
    * New option to customise the default display of contig count and length (eg. `bp` instead of `Mbp`).
    * See [documentation](http://multiqc.info/docs/#quast). Written by [@ewels](https://github.com/ewels/) and [@Cashalow](https://github.com/Cashalow/)
* **RSeQC**
    * Removed normalisation in Junction Saturation plot. Now raw counts instead of % of total junctions.

#### New MultiQC Features:
* Conditional formatting / highlighting of cell contents in tables
    * If you want to make values that match a criteria stand out more, you can now write custom rules and formatting instructions for tables.
    * For instructions, see [the documentation](http://multiqc.info/docs/#conditional-formatting)
* New `--lint` option which is strict about best-practices for writing new modules
    * Useful when writing new modules and code as it throws warnings
    * Currently only implemented for bar plots and a few other places. More linting coming soon...
* If MultiQC breaks and shows am error message, it now reports the filename of the last log it found
    * Hopefully this will help with debugging / finding dodgy input data

#### Bug Fixes
* Addressed new dependency error with conflicting package requirements
    * There was a conflict between the `networkx`, `colormath` and `spectra` releases.
    * I previously forced certain software versions to get around this, but `spectra` has now updated with the unfortunate effect of introducing a new dependency clash that halts installation.
* Fixed newly introduced bug where Custom Content MultiQC config file search patterns had been broken
* Updated pandoc command used in `--pdf` to work with new releases of Pandoc
* Made config `table_columns_visible` module name key matching case insensitive to make less frustrating


## [MultiQC v1.3](https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC/releases/tag/v1.3) - 2017-11-03

#### Breaking changes - custom search patterns
Only for users with custom search patterns for the `bowtie` or `star`: you will
need to update your config files - the `bowtie` search key is now `bowtie1`,
`star_genecounts` is now `star/genecounts`.

For users with custom modules - search patterns _must_ now conform to the search
pattern naming convention: `modulename` or `modulename/anything` (the search pattern
string beginning with the name of your module, anything you like after the first `/`).

    * Many of these spotted and fixed by [@juliangehring](https://github.com/juliangehring/)
* Went through all modules and standardised plot titles
    * All plots should now have a title with the format _Module name: Plot name_

#### New MultiQC Features:
* New MultiQC docker image
    * Ready to use docker image now available at https://hub.docker.com/r/ewels/multiqc/ (200 MB)
    * Uses automated builds - pull `:latest` to get the development version, future releases will have stable tags.

    * Filters mean that a module can be run twice with different sets of files (eg. before and after trimming)
    * Custom module config parameters can be passed to module for each run
* File search refactored to only search for running modules
    * Makes search much faster when running with lots of files and limited modules

## [MultiQC v1.0](https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC/releases/tag/v1.0) - 2017-05-17
Version 1.0! This release has been a long time coming and brings with it some fairly
major improvements in speed, report filesize and report performance. There's also
a bunch of new modules, more options, features and a whole lot of bug fixes.

The version number is being bumped up to 1.0 for a couple of reasons:

1. MultiQC is now _(hopefully)_ relatively stable. A number of facilities and users
   are now using it in a production setting and it's published. It feels like it
   probably deserves v1 status now somehow.
2. This update brings some fairly major changes which will break backwards
   compatibility for plugins. As such, semantic versioning suggests a change in
   major version number.

### Breaking Changes
For most people, you shouldn't have any problems upgrading. There are two
scenarios where you may need to make changes with this update:

#### 1. You have custom file search patterns
Search patterns have been flattened and may no longer have arbitrary depth.
For example, you may need to change the following:
```yaml
fastqc:
    data:
        fn: 'fastqc_data.txt'
    zip:
        fn: '*_fastqc.zip'
```
to this:
```yaml
fastqc/data:
    fn: 'fastqc_data.txt'
fastqc/zip:
    fn: '*_fastqc.zip'
```
See the [documentation](http://multiqc.info/docs/#step-1-find-log-files) for instructions on how to write the new file search syntax.

See [`search_patterns.yaml`](multiqc/utils/search_patterns.yaml) for the new module search keys
and more examples.

####  2. You have custom plugins / modules / external code
To see what changes need to applied to your custom plugin code, please see the [MultiQC docs](http://multiqc.info/docs/#v1.0-updates).

#### New Modules:

    * Significant improvement in search speed (test dataset runs in approximately half the time)
    * More options for modules to find their logs, eg. filename and contents matching regexes (see the [docs](http://multiqc.info/docs/#step-1-find-log-files))
* Report plot data is now compressed, significantly reducing report filesizes.
* New `--ignore-samples` option to skip samples based on parsed sample name
    * Alternative to filtering by input filename, which doesn't always work
    * Also can use config vars `sample_names_ignore` (glob patterns) and `sample_names_ignore_re` (regex patterns).

    * For example, if reports have few reads, can show `Thousands of Reads` instead of `Millions of Reads`
    * Set config options `read_count_multiplier`, `read_count_prefix` and `read_count_desc`
* Config options `decimalPoint_format` and `thousandsSep_format` now apply to tables as well as plots
    * By default, thosands will now be separated with a space and `.` used for decimal places.
* Tables now have a maximum-height by default and scroll within this.
    * Speeds up report rendering in the web browser and makes report less stupidly long with lots of samples
    * Button beneath table toggles full length if you want a zoomed-out view
    * Refactored and removed previous code to make the table header "float"
    * Set `config.collapse_tables` to `False` to disable table maximum-heights

    * Interactive plots sometimes hide labels due to lack of space. These can now be zoomed in on to see specific samples in more detail.
* Report plots now load sequentially instead of all at once
    * Prevents the browser from locking up when large reports load
* Report plot and section HTML IDs are now sanitised and checked for duplicates
* New template available (called _sections_) which has faster loading

    * Makes big reports load in the browser much more quickly, but requires more clicking
    * Try it out by specifying `-t sections`
* Module sections tidied and refactored
    * New helper function `self.add_section()`
    * Sections hidden in nav if no title (no more need for the hacky `self.intro += `)
    * Content broken into `description`, `help` and `plot`, with automatic formatting
    * Empty module sections are now skipped in reports. No need to check if a plot function returns `None`!
    * Changes should be backwards-compatible
* Report plot data export code refactored
    * Now doesn't export hidden samples (uses HighCharts [export-csv](https://github.com/highcharts/export-csv) plugin)
* Handle error when `git` isn't installed on the system.
* Refactored colouring of table cells
    * Was previously done in the browser using [chroma.js](http://gka.github.io/chroma.js/)
    * Now done at report generation time using the [spectra](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/spectra) package
    * Should helpfully speed up report rendering time in the web browser, especially for large reports
* Docs updates (thanks to @varemo)
* Previously hidden log file `.multiqc.log` renamed to `multiqc.log` in `multiqc_data`

* Tables no longer show _Configure Columns_ and _Plot_ buttons if they only have a single column
* Custom content updates
    * New `custom_content`/`order` config option to specify order of Custom Content sections
    * Tables now use the header for the first column instead of always having `Sample Name`
    * JSON + YAML tables now remember order of table columns
    * Many minor bugfixes
* Line graphs and scatter graphs axis limits
    * If limits are specified, data exceeding this is no longer saved in report
    * Visually identical, but can make report file sizes considerable smaller in some cases
* Creating multiple plots without a config dict now works (previously just gave grey boxes in report)
* All changes are now tested on a Windows system, using [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/ewels/multiqc/)
* Fixed rare error where some reports could get empty General Statistics tables when no data present.
* Fixed minor bug where config option `force: true` didn't work. Now you don't have to always specify `-f`!

## [MultiQC v0.8](https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC/releases/tag/v0.8) - 2016-09-26

#### New Modules:

* [**GATK**](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/)
    * Added support for VariantEval reports, only parsing a little of the information
    in there so far, but it's a start.
    * Module originally written by @robinandeer at the [OBF Codefest](https://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Codefest_2016),
    finished off by @ewels
* [**Bcftools**](https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/)
* [**QUAST**](http://quast.bioinf.spbau.ru/)
    * QUAST is a tool for assessing de novo assemblies against reference genomes.

#### Module updates:

* **Bismark** now supports reports from `bam2nuc`, giving Cytosine coverage in General Stats.
* **Bowtie1**
    * Updated to try to find bowtie command before log, handle multiple logs in one file. Same as bowtie2.
* **FastQC**
    * Sample pass/warn/fail lists now display properly even with large numbers of samples
    * Sequence content heatmap display is better with many samples
* **Kallisto**
    * Now supports logs from SE data.
* **Picard**
    * `BaseDistributionByCycle` - new submodule! Written by @mlusignan
    * `RnaSeqMetrics` - new submodule! This one by @ewels ;)

* **RSeQC**
    * `infer_experiment` - new submodule! Written by @Hammarn
* **Samtools**
    * `stats` submodule now has separate bar graph showing alignment scores
    * `flagstat` - new submodule! Written by @HLWiencko
    * `idxstats` - new submodule! This one by @ewels again

#### Core MultiQC updates:
* New `--export`/`-p` option to generate static images plot in `multiqc_plots` (`.png`, `.svg` and `.pdf`)
    * Configurable with `export_plots`, `plots_dir_name` and `export_plot_formats` config options
    * `--flat` option no longer saves plots in `multiqc_data/multiqc_plots`
* New `--comment`/`-b` flag to add a comment to the top of reports.
* New `--dirs-depth`/`-dd` flag to specify how many directories to prepend with `--dirs`/`-d`
    * Specifying a postive number will take that many directories from the end of the path
    * A negative number will take directories from the start of the path.
* Directory paths now appended before cleaning, so `fn_clean_exts` will now affect these names.
* New `custom_logo` attributes to add your own logo to reports.
* New `report_header_info` config option to add arbitrary information to the top of reports.
* New `--pdf` option to create a PDF report

    * This will print the full filename for samples. Less pretty reports and rows
    on the General Statistics table won't line up, but can prevent overwriting.
* Table header defaults can now be set easily
* General Statistics table now hidden if empty.
* Some new defaults in the sample name cleaning
* Updated the `simple` template.
    * Now has no toolbox or nav, no JavaScript and is better suited for printing / PDFs.

    * Other JS errors fixed in this work
* Bugfix for older FastQC reports - handle old style sequence dup data
* Bugfix for varying Tophat alignment report formats
* Bugfix for Qualimap RNA Seq reports with paired end data

## [MultiQC v0.3.1](https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC/releases/tag/v0.3.1) - 2015-11-04
* Hotfix patch to fix broken FastQC module (wasn't finding `.zip` files properly)
* General Stats table colours now flat. Should improve browser speed.
* Empty rows now hidden if appear due to column removal in general stats
* FastQC Kmer plot removed until we have something better to show.

## [MultiQC v0.3](https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC/releases/tag/v0.3) - 2015-11-04
* Lots of lovely new documentation!
* Child templates - easily customise specific parts of the default report template
* Plugin hooks - allow other tools to execute custom code during MultiQC execution
* New Preseq module
* New design for general statistics table (snazzy new background bars)
* Further development of toolbox
    * New button to clear all filters
    * Warnings when samples are hidden, plus empty plots and table cols are hidden
    * Active toolbar tab buttons are highlighted
* Lots of refactoring by @moonso to please the Pythonic gods
    * Switched to click instead of argparse to handle command line arguments
    * Code generally conforms to best practices better now.
* Now able to supply multiple directories to search for reports
* Logging output improved (now controlled by `-q` and `-v` for quiet and verbose)
* More HTML output dealt with by the base module, less left to the modules
    * Module introduction text
    * General statistics table now much easier to add to (new helper functions)
* Images, CSS and Javascript now included in HTML, meaning that there is a single
  report file to make sharing easier
* More accessible scrolling in the report - styled scrollbars and 'to top' button.
* Modules and templates now use setuptools entry points, facilitating plugins
  by other packages. Allows niche extensions whilst keeping the core codebase clean.
* The general stats table now has a sticky header row when scrolling, thanks to
  some new javascript wizardry...
* General stats columns can have a _shared key_ which allows common colour schemes
  and data ranges. For instance, all columns describing a read count will now share
  their scale across modules.
* General stats columns can be hidden and reordered with a new modal window.
* Plotting code refactored, reports with many samples (>50 by default) don't
  automatically render to avoid freezing the browser.
* Plots with highlighted and renamed samples now honour this when exporting to
  different file types.

## [MultiQC v0.2](https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC/releases/tag/v0.2) - 2015-09-18
* Code restructuring for nearly all modules. Common base module
  functions now handle many more functions (plots, config, file import)
    * See the [contributing notes](https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
    for instructions on how to use these new helpers to make your own module
* New report toolbox - sample highlighting, renaming, hiding
    * Config is autosaved by default, can also export to a file for sharing
    * Interactive tour to help users find their way around
* New Tophat, Bowtie 2 and QualiMap modules
    * Thanks to @guillermo-carrasco for the QualiMap module
* Bowtie module now works
* New command line parameter `-d` prefixes sample names with the directory that
  they were found in. Allows duplicate filenames without being overwritten.
* Introduction walkthrough helps show what can be done in the report
* Now compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3
* Software version number now printed on command line properly, and in reports.
* Bugfix: FastQC doesn't break when only one report found
* Bugfix: FastQC seq content heatmap highlighting
* Many, many small bugfixes

## [MultiQC v0.1](https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC/releases/tag/v0.1) - 2015-09-01
* The first public release of MultiQC, after a month of development. Basic
structure in place and modules for FastQC, FastQ Screen, Cutadapt, Bismark,
STAR, Bowtie, Subread featureCounts and Picard MarkDuplicates. Approaching
stability, though still under fairly heavy development.

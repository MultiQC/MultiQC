MultiQC is a tool to create a single report with interactive plots for multiple bioinformatics analyses across many samples.

Reports are generated by scanning given directories for recognised log files.
These are parsed and a single HTML report is generated summarising the statistics
for all logs found. MultiQC reports can describe multiple analysis steps and
large numbers of samples within a single plot, and multiple analysis tools making
it ideal for routine fast quality control.

A very large number of Bioinformatics tools are supported by MultiQC. Please see the MultiQC website for a [complete list](https://multiqc.info/modules/).
MultiQC can also easily parse data from custom scripts, if correctly formatted / configured - a feature called [Custom Content](https://multiqc.info/docs/custom_content/).

More modules are being written all the time. Please suggest any ideas as a new
[issue](https://github.com/MultiQC/MultiQC/issues) _(please include example log files)_.

## Installation

You can install MultiQC from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/multiqc/)
using `pip` as follows:

```bash
pip install multiqc
```

Alternatively, you can install using [Conda](http://anaconda.org/)
from [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) ([set up your channels](https://bioconda.github.io/#usage) first):

```bash
conda install multiqc
```

If you would like the development version from GitHub instead, you can install it with `pip`:

```bash
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/MultiQC/MultiQC.git
```

MultiQC is also available via Docker and Singularity images, Galaxy wrappers, and
many more software distribution systems.
See [the documentation](https://multiqc.info/docs/getting_started/installation/) for details.

## Usage

Once installed, you can use MultiQC by navigating to your analysis directory
(or a parent directory) and running the tool:

```bash
multiqc .
```

That's it! MultiQC will scan the specified directory (`.` is the current dir)
and produce a report detailing whatever it finds.

<!-- RICH-CODEX fake_command: "multiqc ." -->

![`cd test-data/data/modules/fastqc/v0.10.1 && multiqc .`](https://github.com/MultiQC/MultiQC/raw/main/docs/images/screenshots/fastqc-run.svg)

The report is created in `multiqc_report.html` by default. Tab-delimited data
files are also created in `multiqc_data/`, containing extra information.
These can be easily inspected using Excel (use `--data-format` to get `yaml`
or `json` instead).

For more detailed instructions, run `multiqc -h` or see the
[documentation](http://multiqc.info/docs/#running-multiqc).

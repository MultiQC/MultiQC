-----

MultiQC is a tool to create a single report with interactive plots
for multiple bioinformatics analyses across many samples.

MultiQC is written in Python (tested with v3.6+). It is
available on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/multiqc/)
and through conda using [Bioconda](http://bioconda.github.io/).

Reports are generated by scanning given directories for recognised log files.
These are parsed and a single HTML report is generated summarising the statistics
for all logs found. MultiQC reports can describe multiple analysis steps and
large numbers of samples within a single plot, and multiple analysis tools making
it ideal for routine fast quality control.

There a very large number of Bioinformatics tools supported by MultiQC.
Please see the MultiQC website for a [complete list](https://multiqc.info/#supported-tools).

MultiQC can also easily parse data from custom scripts, if correctly formatted / configured.
See the [MultiQC documentation](http://multiqc.info/docs/#custom-content) for more information.

Please note that some modules only recognise output from certain tool subcommands.
Please see the [module documentation](http://multiqc.info/docs/#multiqc-modules) for more information.

More modules are being written all of the time. Please suggest any ideas as a new
[issue](https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC/issues) _(include an example log file if possible)_.

## Installation

You can install MultiQC from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/multiqc/)
using `pip` as follows:
```bash
pip install multiqc
```

Alternatively, you can install using [Conda](http://anaconda.org/)
from the [bioconda channel](https://bioconda.github.io/):
```bash
conda install -c bioconda multiqc
```

If you would like the development version instead, the command is:
```bash
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC.git
```

MultiQC is also available in the
[Galaxy Toolshed](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/engineson/multiqc/).

## Usage
Once installed, you can use MultiQC by navigating to your analysis directory
(or a parent directory) and running the tool:
```bash
multiqc .
```

That's it! MultiQC will scan the specified directory (`.` is the current dir)
and produce a report detailing whatever it finds.

The report is created in `multiqc_report.html` by default. Tab-delimited data
files are also created in `multiqc_data/`, containing extra information.
These can be easily inspected using Excel (use `--data-format` to get `yaml`
or `json` instead).

For more detailed instructions, run `multiqc -h` or see the
[documentation](http://multiqc.info/docs/#running-multiqc).

## Contributions & Support

Contributions and suggestions for new features are welcome, as are bug reports!
Please create a new [issue](https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC/issues) for any
of these, including example reports where possible. MultiQC has extensive
[documentation](http://multiqc.info/docs) describing how to write new modules,
plugins and templates.

There is a chat room for the package hosted on Gitter where you can discuss
things with the package author and other developers:
https://gitter.im/ewels/MultiQC

This module parses the report generated by Bustools `inspect`, and expects the file to be
named `inspect.json`. This is the default naming pattern when you make use of the
[kallisto-bustools wrapper](https://www.kallistobus.tools/). The sample name is set as the name
of the directory containing the file. For the rest, this module should work in exactly the same
way as all other MultiQC modules.

### File search patterns

```yaml
bustools:
  fn: "*inspect.json"
```

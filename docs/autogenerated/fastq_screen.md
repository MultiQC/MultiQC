By default, the module creates a plot that emulates the FastQ Screen output
with blue and red stacked bars showing unique and multimapping read counts.
This plot only works for a handful of samples however, so if
`# samples * # organisms >= 160`, a simpler stacked barplot is shown. This
is also shown when generating flat-image plots.

To always show this style of plot, add the following line to a MultiQC config file:

```yaml
fastqscreen_simpleplot: true
```

### File search patterns

```yaml
fastq_screen:
  fn: "*_screen.txt"
```

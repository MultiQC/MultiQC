  HTStream is a quality control and processing pipeline for High Throughput Sequencing data. The
  difference between HTStream and other tools is that HTStream uses a tab delimited fastq format 
  that allows for streaming from application to application. This streaming creates some awesome 
  efficiencies when processing HTS data and makes it fully interoperable with other standard Linux 
  tools.

The HTStream module parses json files generated by
[HTStream](https://github.com/s4hts/HTStream), a quality control and preprocessing pipeline for High Throughput Sequencing data.

The Illumina InterOp libraries are a set of common routines used for reading and writing InterOp metric files.
These metric files are binary files produced during a run providing detailed statistics about a run. In a few
cases, the metric files are produced after a run during secondary analysis (index metrics) or for faster display
of a subset of the original data (collapsed quality scores).

This module parses the output from the InterOp Summary executable and creates a table view. The aim is to
replicate the `Run & Lane Metrics` table from the [Illumina Basespace](https://basespace.illumina.com) interface.
The executable used can easily be installed from the BioConda channel using
`conda install -c bioconda illumina-interop`.

The MultiQC interop module can parse the outputs of the `interop_summary` and `interop_index-summary` executables.
Note that these must be run with the `--csv=1` option.

interop/summary:
  contents: Level,Yield,Projected Yield,Aligned,Error Rate,Intensity C1,%>=Q30
```

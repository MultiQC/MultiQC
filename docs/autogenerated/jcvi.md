The JCVI module parses the output of `python -m jcvi.annotation.stats genestats <input.gff>`.
The file name is used as the sample name.
If the output from the `python -m jcvi.annotation.stats stats <input.gff>` is present in the same directory,
it is used to draw complementary plots.

A typical result directory will contain:

```
├── Exon_Count
│   ├── sample1.txt
│   └── sample2.txt
├── Exon_Length
│   ├── sample1.txt
│   └── sample2.txt
├── Gene_Length
│   ├── sample1.txt
│   └── sample2.txt
├── Intron_Length
│   ├── sample1.txt
│   └── sample2.txt
├── sample1_genestats.txt
└── sample2_genestats.txt

```

The JCVI module has been tested with output from JCVI v1.0.9.

### File search patterns

```yaml
jcvi:
  contents: "     o    % GC    % of genome    Average size (bp)    Median size (bp)    Number    Total
    length (Mb)"
```

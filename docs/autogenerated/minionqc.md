  Quality control for ONT (Oxford Nanopore) long reads
---

It uses the `sequencing_summary.txt` files produced by ONT (Oxford Nanopore Technologies)
long-read base-callers to perform QC on the reads. It allows quick-and-easy comparison of data from
multiple flowcells

The module parses data in the `summary.yaml` MinIONQC output files.

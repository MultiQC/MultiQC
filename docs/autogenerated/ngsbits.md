The ngs-bits module parses XML output generated for several tools in the ngs-bits collection:

- [ReadQC](https://github.com/imgag/ngs-bits/blob/master/doc/tools/ReadQC.md) for statistics on FASTQ files,
- [MappingQC](https://github.com/imgag/ngs-bits/blob/master/doc/tools/MappingQC.md) for statistics on BAM files

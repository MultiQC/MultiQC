Used to generate three quality metrics: NSC, RSC, and PBC. The NSC (Normalized strand cross-correlation)
and RSC (relative strand cross-correlation) metrics use cross-correlation of stranded read density profiles
to measure enrichment independently of peak calling. The PBC (PCR bottleneck coefficient) is an approximate
measure of library complexity. PBC is the ratio of (non-redundant, uniquely mappable reads)/(uniquely mappable reads).

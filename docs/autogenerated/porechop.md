summary: >
  Finds and removes adapters from Oxford Nanopore reads
extra_description: >
  Adapters on the ends of reads are trimmed off, and when a read has an adapter in its middle,
  it is treated as chimeric and chopped into separate reads. Porechop performs thorough alignments to
  effectively find adapters, even at low sequence identity.

The module parses the log file generated by [Porechop](https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop), which is a tool
for demultiplexing and processing nanopore data.

The module takes summary statistics of numbers of adapters and number of reads trimmed and displays them in
the General Stats table as well as barplots.

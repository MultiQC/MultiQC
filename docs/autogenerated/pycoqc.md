PycoQC relies on the `sequencing_summary.txt` file generated by Albacore and Guppy,
but if needed it can also generate a summary file from basecalled `fast5` files.

The package supports 1D and 1D2 runs generated with MinION, GridION and PromethION
devices and basecalled with Albacore 1.2.1+ or Guppy 2.1.3+.

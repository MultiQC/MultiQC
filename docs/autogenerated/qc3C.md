  Reference-free and BAM based quality control for Hi-C data
---

qc3C allows researchers to assess the fraction of read-pairs within a Hi-C library that are a product
of proximity ligation -- in effect the Hi-C signal strength. Using a k-mer based approach, signal strength
is inferred directly from reads and therefore no reference is required. Reference based assessment is also
available and can provide further details.
With this information in hand, researchers are able to decide how much sequencing will be needed to achieve
their experimental aims.

summary: >
  Reference-free and BAM based quality control for Hi-C data
extra_description: >
  qc3C allows researchers to assess the fraction of read-pairs within a Hi-C library that are a product
  of proximity ligation -- in effect the Hi-C signal strength. Using a k-mer based approach, signal strength
  is inferred directly from reads and therefore no reference is required. Reference based assessment is also
  available and can provide further details.
  With this information in hand, researchers are able to decide how much sequencing will be needed to achieve
  their experimental aims.

Aids in the detection and identification of errors, biases, and artifacts produced by paired-end high-throughput RNA-Seq technology. In addition, it can produce count data designed for use with differential expression and differential exon usage tools, as well as individual-sample and/or group-summary genome track files suitable for use with the UCSC genome browser.

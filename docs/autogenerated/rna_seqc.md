The module parses results generated by RNA-SeQC (not to be confused with
[RSeQC](http://rseqc.sourceforge.net/), which MultiQC also supports).

This module shows the Spearman correlation heatmap if both
Spearman and Pearson's are found. To plot Pearson's by default instead,
add the following to your MultiQC config file:

```yaml
rna_seqc:
  default_correlation: pearson
```

### File search patterns

```yaml
rna_seqc/correlation:
  fn_re: corrMatrix(Pearson|Spearman)\.txt
rna_seqc/coverage:
  fn_re: meanCoverageNorm_(high|medium|low)\.txt
rna_seqc/metrics_v1:
  contents: "Sample\tNote\t"
  fn: "*metrics.tsv"
rna_seqc/metrics_v2:
  contents: High Quality Ambiguous Alignment Rate
  fn: "*metrics.tsv"
```

Seqera Platform CLI module for MultiQC.

Parses a tar-gz dump containing logs and stats from a Seqera Platform run, that is,
the `runs_SmUkr43Nul49G.tar.gz` file generated by the following command:

```sh
tw runs dump -id=SmUkr43Nul49G --workspace=seqeralabs/benchmarks --output=runs_SmUkr43Nul49G.tar.gz
```

Expects the dump to contain a `workflow.json` file, along with `workflow-load.json`.

To allow reading the tar-gz archives, run with `ignore_images: false` in the config, e.g.:

```sh
multiqc . --cl-config 'ignore_images: false'
```

Can also parse an uncompressed version of the dump, that is, a `workflow.json` file
and a `workflow-load.json` sitting together in a directory.

### File search patterns

```yaml
seqera_cli/json:
  fn: workflow.json
seqera_cli/run_dump:
  fn: runs_*.tar.gz
```

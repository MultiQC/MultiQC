The module parsed results generated by the `xenome classify` command.

**Note**: MultiQC parses the standard output from xengsort, hence one has to redirect
command line output to a file in order to use it with the MultiQC module. Also note that
the tool does not register any sample name information in the output, so MultiQC
attempts to fetch the sample name from the file name by default. Example command that
would help MultiQC recognize data for a sample named "SAMPLE":

```sh
xenome classify -P idx --pairs -i in_1.fastq -i in_2.fastq > SAMPLE.txt
```

### File search patterns

```yaml
xenome:
  contents: "B\tG\tH\tM\tcount\tpercent\tclass"
  num_lines: 2
```

# Documentation

## Admonitions

Admonitions, sometimes known as call-outs, can be used to highlight relevant information in the docs so that it stands out of the main flow of text.

The MultiQC website uses [remark-directive](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-directive) to add a set of custom styled admonition directives to markdown syntax, shown below.

### Custom titles

```md
:::note{title="Don't Panic"}
Arthur Dent was grappling with his consciousness the way one grapples with a lost bar of soap in the bath. He lay, panting heavily in the wet air, and tried feeling bits of himself to see where he might be hurt. Wherever he touched himself, he encountered a pain. After a short while he worked out that this was because it was his hand that was hurting. Arthur nodded intelligently. Today was one of those bad days.

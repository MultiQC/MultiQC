# Plotting Functions

MultiQC plotting functions are held within `multiqc.plots` submodules.
To use them, simply import the modules you want, e.g.:

```python
from multiqc.plots import bargraph, linegraph
```

Once you've done that, you will have access to the corresponding plotting
functions:

```python
from multiqc.plots import bargraph, linegraph, scatter, table, violin, heatmap, box
bargraph.plot(data=..., cats=..., pconfig=...)
linegraph.plot(data=..., pconfig=...)
scatter.plot(data=..., pconfig=...)
table.plot(data=..., headers=..., pconfig=...)
violin.plot(data=..., headers=..., pconfig=...)
heatmap.plot(data=..., xcats=..., ycats=..., pconfig=...)
box.plot(list_of_data_by_sample=..., pconfig=...)
```

These have been designed to work in a similar manner to each other - you
pass a data structure to them, along with optional extras such as categories
and configuration options, and they return a string of HTML to add to the
report. You can add this to the module introduction or sections as described
above. For example:

```python
self.add_section(
    name="Module Section",
    anchor="mymod_section",
    description="This plot shows some really nice data.",
    helptext="This longer string (can be **markdown**) helps explain how to interpret the plot",
    plot=bargraph.plot(data, cats=..., pconfig=...)
)
```

## Common options

All plots should as a minimum have a config with an `id` and a `title`.
MultiQC is written to work with sensible defaults, so won't complain if you
don't supply these, but it's good practice for usability (the ID is used as
a filename when exporting plots, and all plots should have a title when exported).

Plot titles should use the format _Module name: Plot name_ (this is partly for
ease of use within MegaQC and other downstream tools).

## Bar graphs

Simple data can be plotted in bar graphs. Many MultiQC modules make use
of stacked bar graphs. Here, the `bargraph.plot()` function comes to
the rescue. A basic example is as follows:

```python
from multiqc.plots import bargraph
data = {
    'sample 1': {
        'aligned': 23542,
        'not_aligned': 343,
    },
    'sample 2': {
        'not_aligned': 7328,
        'aligned': 1275,
    }
}
html = bargraph.plot(data, pconfig=...)
```

To specify the order of categories in the plot, you can supply a list of
dictionary keys. This can also be used to exclude a key from the plot.

```python
cats = ['aligned', 'not_aligned']
html = bargraph.plot(data, cats, pconfig=...)
```

If `cats` is given as a dict instead of a list, you can specify a nice name
and a colour too:

```python
cats = {
    "aligned": {
        'name': 'Aligned Reads',
        'color': '#8bbc21'
    },
    "not_aligned": {
        'name': 'Unaligned Reads',
        'color': '#f7a35c'
    }
}
```

Finally, a third variable should be supplied with configuration variables for
the plot. The defaults are as follows:

```python
config = {
    # Building the plot
    "id": "<random string>",                  # HTML ID used for the plot
    "cpswitch": True,                         # Show the 'Counts / Percentages' switch?
    "cpswitch_c_active": True,                # Initial display with 'Counts' specified? False for percentages.
    "cpswitch_counts_label": "Counts",        # Label for 'Counts' button
    "cpswitch_percent_label": "Percentages",  # Label for 'Percentages' button
    "logswitch": False,                       # Show the 'Log10' switch?
    "logswitch_active": False,                # Initial display with 'Log10' active?
    "logswitch_label": "Log10",               # Label for 'Log10' button
    "hide_zero_cats": True,                   # Hide categories where data for all samples is 0
    # Customising the plot
    "title": None,                            # Plot title - should be in format "Module Name: Plot Title"
    "ylab": None,                             # Y axis label
    "ymax": None,                             # Max bar size limit (default is calculated from data)
    "tt_label": "{x}: {y:.2f}%",              # Customise tooltip label
    "xsuffix": "%",                           # Suffix for the x-axis values and labels. Parsed from tt_label by default
    "ysuffix": "%",                           # Suffix for the y-axis values and labels. Parsed from tt_label by default
    "stacking": "relative",                   # Set to "group" to have category bars side by side
    "tt_decimals": 0,                         # Number of decimal places to use in the tooltip number
    "tt_suffix": "",                          # Suffix to add after tooltip number
    "height": 500                             # The default height of the plot, in pixels
}
```

:::note
The keys `id` and `title` should always be passed as a minimum.

The `id` is used for the plot name when exporting.
If left unset the Plot Export panel will call the filename
`mqc_hcplot_gtucwirdzx.png` (with some other random string).

Plots should always have titles, especially as they can stand by themselves
when exported. The title should have the format `Modulename: Plot Name`
:::

### Switching datasets

It's possible to have single plot with buttons to switch between different
datasets. To do this, give a list of data objects to the `plot` function
and specify the `data_labels` config option with the text to be used for the buttons:

```python
pconfig = {
    'data_labels': ['Reads', 'Bases']
}
html = bargraph.plot([data1, data2], pconfig=pconfig)
```

You can also customise any plot configuration per-dataset, for example,
the y-axis label, min/max values, or title:

```python
pconfig = {
    "data_labels": [
        {
            "name": "Reads",  # Button label
            "ylab": "Reads",  # Y-axis label
        },
        {
            "name": "Base Pairs",
            "ylab": "Base Pairs",
            "ymax": 100,
            "title": "Number of Base Pairs",  # Plot title
        },
    ]
}
```

If supplying multiple datasets, you can also supply a list of category
objects. Make sure that they are in the same order as the data.

Categories should contain data keys, so if you're supplying a list of two datasets,
you should supply a list of two sets of keys for the categories. MultiQC will try to
guess categories from the data keys if categories are missing.

For example, with two datasets supplied as above:

```python
cats = [
    ["aligned_reads", "unaligned_reads"],
    ["aligned_base_pairs", "unaligned_base_pairs"],
]
```

Or with additional customisation such as name and colour:

```python
cats = [
    {
        "aligned_reads": {"name": "Aligned Reads", "color": "#8bbc21"},
        "unaligned_reads": {"name": "Unaligned Reads", "color": "#f7a35c"},
    },
    {
        "aligned_base_pairs": {"name": "Aligned Base Pairs", "color": "#8bbc21"},
        "unaligned_base_pairs": {"name": "Unaligned Base Pairs", "color": "#f7a35c"},
    },
]
html = bargraph.plot([data, data], cats, pconfig=...)
```

Note that, as in this example, the plot data can be the same dictionary supplied twice.

## Line graphs

This base function works much like the above, but for two-dimensional
data, to produce line graphs. It expects a dictionary with sample identifiers,
each containing numeric `x:y` points. For example:

```python
from multiqc.plots import linegraph
data = {
    "sample 1": {
        "<x val 1>": "<y val 1>",
        "<x val 2>": "<y val 2>",
    },
    "sample 2": {
        "<x val 1>": "<y val 1>",
        "<x val 2>": "<y val 2>",
    },
}

html = linegraph.plot(data)
```

Additionally, a configuration dict can be supplied. The defaults are as follows:

```python
pconfig = {
    # Building the plot
    "id": "<random string>",     # HTML ID used for plot
    "categories": False,         # Set to True to use x values as categories instead of numbers.
    "colors": dict(),            # Provide dict with keys = sample names and values colours
    "smooth_points": None,       # Supply a number to limit number of points / smooth data
    "smooth_points_sumcounts": True,  # Sum counts in bins, or average? Can supply list for multiple datasets
    "logswitch": False,          # Show the 'Log10' switch?
    "logswitch_active": False,   # Initial display with 'Log10' active?
    "logswitch_label": "Log10",  # Label for 'Log10' button
    "extra_series": None,        # See section below
    # Plot configuration
    "title": None,               # Plot title - should be in format "Module Name: Plot Title"
    "xlab": None,                # X axis label
    "ylab": None,                # Y axis label
    "xmax": None,                # Hard max x limit
    "xmin": None,                # Hard min x limit
    "ymax": None,                # Hard max y limit
    "ymin": None,                # Hard min y limit
    "x_clipmax": None,           # Max value allowed for automatic axis limit
    "x_clipmin": None,           # Min value allowed for automatic axis limit
    "y_clipmax": None,           # Max value allowed for automatic axis limit
    "y_clipmin": None,           # Min value allowed for automatic axis limit
    "x_minrange": None,          # Min range for x-axis (5 would allow 0..5, but also 15..20, etc.)
    "y_minrange": None,          # Min range for y-axis (5 would allow 0..5, but also 15..20, etc.)
    "xlog": False,               # Use log10 for the x-axis
    "ylog": False,               # Use log10 scale for the y-axis
    "y_bands": None,             # Horizontal colored background bands
    "x_bands": None,             # Vertical colored background bands
    "y_lines": None,             # Extra horizontal lines
    "x_lines": None,             # Extra vertical lines
    "tt_label": "{x}: {y:.2f}",  # Use to customise tooltip label, e.g. '{point.x} base pairs'
    "tt_decimals": None,         # Tooltip decimals when categories = True (when false use tt_label)
    "tt_suffix": None,           # Tooltip suffix when categories = True (when false use tt_label)
    "height": 500,               # The default height of the plot, in pixels
    "style": "line",             # The style of the line. Can be "line" or "lines+markers"
}
html = linegraph.plot(..., pconfig)
```

:::note
The keys `id` and `title` should always be passed as a minimum.

The `id` is used for the plot name when exporting.
If left unset the Plot Export panel will call the filename
`mqc_hcplot_gtucwirdzx.png` (with some other random string).

Plots should always have titles, especially as they can stand by themselves
when exported. The title should have the format `Modulename: Plot Name`
:::

### Switching datasets

You can also have a single plot with buttons to switch between different
datasets. To do this, just supply a list of data dicts instead (same
formats as described above). For example:

```python
data = [
    {
        "sample 1": {"<x val 1>": "<y val 1>", "<x val 2>": "<y val 2>"},
        "sample 2": {"<x val 1>": "<y val 1>", "<x val 2>": "<y val 2>"},
    },
    {
        "sample 1": {"<x val 1>": "<y val 1>", "<x val 2>": "<y val 2>"},
        "sample 2": {"<x val 1>": "<y val 1>", "<x val 2>": "<y val 2>"},
    },
]
```

You'll also want to add the following configuration options to
give names to the buttons and graph labels:

```python
config = {
    "data_labels": [
        {
            "name": "DS 1",  # Button label
            "ylab": "y axis 1",  # Y-axis label
            "xlab": "x axis 1",  # X-axis label
        },
        {
            "name": "DS 2",
            "ylab": "y axis 2",
            "xlab": "x axis 2",
        },
    ]
}
```

All of these config values are optional, the function will default
to sensible values if things are missing.

### Additional data series

Sometimes, it's good to be able to specify specific data series manually.
To do this, use `config['extra_series']`. For a single extra line this can
be a dict (as below). For multiple lines, use a list of dicts. For multiple
dataset plots, use a list of list of dicts.

For example, to add a dotted `x = y` reference line:

```python
from multiqc.plots import linegraph
pconfig = {
    "extra_series": {
        "name": "x = y",
        "data": [[0, 0], [max_x_val, max_y_val]],
        "dash": "dash",
        "width": 1,
        "color": "#000000",
        "marker": {"enabled": False},
        "showlegend": False,
    }
}
html = linegraph.plot(data, pconfig)
```

## Box plots

Box plots take similar data structure as line plots, but better visualize the
underlying data distribution by emphasizing quartiles, mean, median, standard
deviation, the extreme values and the outliers.

Instead of x:y pairs, the box plot take a flat list of points for each sample:

```python
from multiqc.plots import box
data = {
    "sample 1": [9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
    "sample 2": [2, 4, 6, 6, 6, 10, 0, 1],
}
html = box.plot(data, pconfig=...)
```

Similarly to other plot types, multiple datasets can be passed as `data`, along with
dataset-specific configurations provided with the `pconfig["data_labels"]` option.

## Scatter Plots

Scatter plots work in almost exactly the same way as line plots. Most (if not all)
config options are shared between the two. The data structure is similar but not identical:

```python
from multiqc.plots import scatter
data = {
    "sample 1": {
        "x": "<x val>",
        "y": "<y val>",
    },
    "sample 2": {
        "x": "<x val>",
        "y": "<y val>",
    },
}
html = scatter.plot(data)
```

Note that you must use the keys `x` and `y` for each data point.

If you want more than one data point per sample, you can supply a list of
dictionaries instead. You can also optionally specify point colours and
sample name suffixes (these are appended to the sample name):

```python
data = {
    "sample 1": [
        {"x": "<x val>", "y": "<y val>", "color": "#a6cee3", "name": "Type 1"},
        {"x": "<x val>", "y": "<y val>", "color": "#1f78b4", "name": "Type 2"},
    ],
    "sample 2": [
        {"x": "<x val>", "y": "<y val>", "color": "#b2df8a", "name": "Type 1"},
        {"x": "<x val>", "y": "<y val>", "color": "#33a02c", "name": "Type 2"},
    ],
}
```

Remember that MultiQC reports can contain large numbers of samples, so this plot type
is **not** suitable for large quantities of data - 20,000 genes might look good
for one sample, but when someone runs MultiQC with 500 samples, it will crash
the browser and be impossible to interpret.

See the documentation about line plots for most config options. The scatter plot
has a handful of unique ones in addition:

```python
pconfig = {
    "marker_colour": "rgba(124, 181, 236, .5)",  # string, base colour of points (recommend rgba / semi-transparent)
    "marker_size": 5,  # int, size of points
    "marker_line_colour": "#999",  # string, colour of point border
    "marker_line_width": 1,  # int, width of point border
    "square": False,  # Force the plot to stay square? (Maintain aspect ratio)
    "xmin": None,  # Hard min x limit
    "xmax": None,  # Hard max x limit
    "ymin": None,  # Hard min y limit
    "ymax": None,  # Hard max y limit
    "x_clipmin": None,  # Min value allowed for automatic axis limit
    "x_clipmax": None,  # Max value allowed for automatic axis limit
    "y_clipmin": None,  # Min value allowed for automatic axis limit
    "y_clipmax": None,  # Max value allowed for automatic axis limit
}
```

## Creating a table

Tables should work just like the functions above (most like the bar
graph function). As a minimum, the function takes a dictionary containing
data - the first keys will be sample names (row headers) and each key
contained within will be a table column header.

You can also supply a list of key names to restrict the data in the table
to certain keys / columns. This also specifies the order that columns
should be displayed in.

For more customisation, the headers can be supplied as a dictionary. Each
key should match the keys used in the data dictionary, but values can
customise the output.

Finally, the function accepts a config dictionary as a third parameter.
This can set global options for the table (e.g. a title) and can also hold
default values to customise the output of all table columns.

The default header keys are:

```python
single_header = {
    "namespace": "",                 # Name for grouping. Prepends desc and is in Config Columns modal
    "title": "[ dict key ]",         # Short title, table column title
    "description": "[ dict key ]",   # Longer description, goes in mouse hover text
    "max": None,                     # Minimum value in range, for bar / colour coding
    "min": None,                     # Maximum value in range, for bar / colour coding
    "ceiling": None,                 # Maximum value for automatic bar limit
    "floor": None,                   # Minimum value for automatic bar limit
    "minrange": None,                # Minimum range for automatic bar
    "scale": "GnBu",                 # Colour scale for colour coding. False to disable.
    "bgcols": None,                  # Dict with values: background colours for categorical data.
    "colour": "<auto>",              # Colour for column grouping
    "suffix": None,                  # Suffix for value (e.g. '%')
    "format": "{:,.1f}",             # Value format string - default 1 decimal place
    "cond_formatting_rules": None,   # Rules for conditional formatting table cell values - see docs below
    "cond_formatting_colours": None, # Styles for conditional formatting of table cell values
    "shared_key": None,              # See below for description
    "modify": None,                  # Lambda function to modify values
    "hidden": False,                 # Set to True to hide the column on page load
}
```

A third parameter can be specified with settings for the whole table:

```python
table_config = {
    "namespace": "",                           # Name for grouping. Prepends desc and is in Config Columns modal
    "id": "<random string>",                   # ID used for the table
    "table_title": "<table id>",               # Title of the table. Used in the column config modal
    "save_file": False,                        # Whether to save the table data to a file
    "raw_data_fn": "multiqc_<table_id>_table", # File basename to use for raw data file
    "sort_rows": True,                          # Whether to sort rows alphabetically
    "only_defined_headers": True,              # Only show columns that are defined in the headers config
    "col1_header": "Sample Name",              # The header used for the first column
    "no_violin": False,                        # Force a table to always be plotted (beeswarm by default if many rows)
}
```

Most of the header keys can also be specified in the table config
(`namespace`, `scale`, `format`, `colour`, `hidden`, `max`, `min`, `ceiling`, `floor`, `minrange`, `shared_key`, `modify`).
These will then be applied to all columns prior to applying column-specific heading config.

A very basic example of creating a table is shown below:

```python
from multiqc.plots import table
data = {
    "sample 1": {
        "aligned": 23542,
        "not_aligned": 343,
    },
    "sample 2": {
        "aligned": 1275,
        "not_aligned": 7328,
    },
}
html = table.plot(data, headers=..., pconfig=...)
```

A more complicated version with ordered columns, defaults and column-specific
settings (e.g. no decimal places):

```python
data = {
    "sample 1": {
        "aligned": 23542,
        "not_aligned": 343,
        "aligned_percent": 98.563952271,
    },
    "sample 2": {
        "aligned": 1275,
        "not_aligned": 7328,
        "aligned_percent": 14.820411484,
    },
}
headers = {
    "aligned_percent": {
        "title": "% Aligned",
        "description": "Percentage of reads that aligned",
        "suffix": "%",
        "max": 100,
        "format": "{:,.0f}",  # No decimal places please
    },
    "aligned": {
        "title": "Aligned",
        "description": f"Aligned Reads ({config.read_count_desc})",
        "shared_key": "read_count",
        "suffix": f" {config.read_count_prefix}",
        "modify": lambda x: x * config.read_count_multiplier,
    },
    "config": {
        "namespace": "My Module",
        "min": 0,
        "scale": "GnBu",
    },
}
html = table.plot(data, headers=headers, pconfig=...)
```

### Table decimal places

You can customise how many decimal places a number has by using the `format` config
key for that column. The default format string is `"{:,.1f}"`, which specifies a
float number with a single decimal place. To remove decimals use `"{:,d}"`.
To have two decimal places, use `"{:,.2f}"`.

### Table colour scales

Colour scales are taken from [ColorBrewer2](http://colorbrewer2.org/).
Colour scales can be reversed by adding the suffix `-rev` to the name. For example, `RdYlGn-rev`.

The following scales are available:

### Custom cell background colours

You can specify custom background colours for specific values using the `bgcols`
header config. This takes precedence over `scale`.

For example, a header config for a column could look like this:

```python
headers[tablecol] = {
    "title": "My table column",
    "bgcols": {
        "bad data": "#f8d7da",
        "ok data": "#fff3cd",
        "good data": "#d1e7dd"
    }
}
```

### Zero centrepoints

If you set the header config `bars_zero_centrepoint` to `True`, the background bars
will use the absolute values to calculate bar width. So a value of `0` will have a bar
width of `0`, `20` a width of `20` and `-30` a width of `30`.

This works well with a divergent colour-scheme as the bar width shows the magnitude
of the value properly, whilst the colour scheme shows the difference between positive
and negative values.

For example:

```python
headers[tablecol] = {
    "title": "My table column",
    "scale": "RdYlGn",
    "bars_zero_centrepoint": True,
}
```

### Conditional formatting of data values

MultiQC has configuration options to allow users to configure
["Conditional formatting"](../reports/customisation.md#conditional-formatting),
with highlighted values in table cells.

Developers can also make use of this functionality within the header config dictionaries
for formatting data values.

The functionality follows the same logic as for user configs with the parameters
`cond_formatting_rules` and `cond_formatting_colours`. These correspond to the
user config options `table_cond_formatting_rules` and `table_cond_formatting_colours`,
with the exception that no column ID is needed for `table_cond_formatting_rules`.

For example, a simple header config could look as follows:

```python
headers[instrument] = {
    "title": "My table column",
    "cond_formatting_rules": {
        "pass": [{"s_eq": "good data"}],
        "warn": [{"s_eq": "ok data"}],
        "fail": [{"s_eq": "bad data"}],
    }
}
```

A more complex version with multiple rules could be:

```python
headers[tablecol] = {
    "title": "My table column",
    "cond_formatting_rules": {
        "brightgreen": [
            {"s_contains": "amazing"},
            {"s_contains": "incredible"},
        ],
        "brown": [{"s_ne": "rubbish-data"}],
        "turquoise": [
            {"gt": 4},
            {"lt": 12},
        ],
    },
    "cond_formatting_colours": [
        {"brightgreen": "#39FF14"},
        {"brown": "#A52A2A"},
        {"turquoise": "#30D5C8"},
    ]
}
```

### Specifying sorting of columns

By default, each table is sorted by sample name alphabetically. You can override the
sorting order using the `defaultsort` option. Here is an example:

```yaml
custom_plot_config:
  general_stats_table:
    defaultsort:
      - column: "Mean Insert Length"
        direction: asc
      - column: "Starting Amount (ng)"
  quast_table:
    defaultsort:
      - column: "Largest contig"
```

In this case, the general stats table will be sorted by "Mean Insert Length" first,
in ascending order, then by "Starting Amount (ng)", in descending (default) order. The
table with the ID `quast_table` (which you can find by clicking the "Configure Columns"
button above the table in the report) will be sorted by "Largest contig".

## Violin plots

Violin plots work from the exact same data structure as tables, so the
usage is just the same. Moreover, a for every table, a switch button is available
to view a corresponding violin plot for the underlying data.

```python
from multiqc.plots import violin
data = {
    "sample 1": {
        "aligned": 23542,
        "not_aligned": 343,
    },
    "sample 2": {
        "not_aligned": 7328,
        "aligned": 1275,
    },
}
html = not violin.plot(data, headers=..., pconfig=...)
```

The function also accepts the same headers and config parameters.

## Heatmaps

Heatmaps expect data in the structure of a list of lists. Then, a list
of sample names for the x-axis, and optionally for the y-axis (defaults
to the same as the x-axis).

```python
heatmap.plot(data, xcats, ycats, pconfig)
```

A simple example:

```python
from multiqc.plots import heatmap
data = [
    [0.9, 0.87, 0.73, 0.6, 0.2, 0.3],
    [0.87, 1, 0.7, 0.6, 0.9, 0.3],
    [0.73, 0.8, 1, 0.6, 0.9, 0.3],
    [0.6, 0.8, 0.7, 1, 0.9, 0.3],
    [0.2, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 1, 0.3],
    [0.3, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.9, 1],
]
names = ["one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
html = heatmap.plot(data, xcats=names, pconfig=...)
```

Alternatively you can supply a dictionary of dictionaries, in which case
xcats and ycats are optional:

```python
data = {
    "sample 1": {
        "one": 0.9,
        "two": 0.87,
        "three": 0.73,
        "four": 0.6,
        "five": 0.2,
    },
    "sample 2": {
        "two": 1,
        "three": 0.7,
        "four": 0.6,
        "six": 0.3,
    },
}
html = heatmap.plot(data, pconfig=...)
```

Much like the other plots, you can change the way that the heatmap looks
using a config dictionary:

```python
pconfig = {
    "title": None,                 # Plot title - should be in format "Module Name: Plot Title"
    "xlab": None,                  # X-axis title
    "ylab": None,                  # Y-axis title
    "zlab": None,                  # Z-axis title, shown in the hover tooltip
    "min": None,                   # Minimum value (default: auto)
    "max": None,                   # Maximum value (default: auto)
    "square": True,                # Force the plot to stay square? (Maintain aspect ratio)
    "xcats_samples": True,         # Is the x-axis sample names? Set to "False" to prevent report toolbox from affecting.
    "ycats_samples": True,         # Is the y-axis sample names? Set to "False" to prevent report toolbox from affecting.
    "colstops": [],                # Scale colour stops. See below.
    "reverseColors": False,        # Reverse the order of the colour axis
    "tt_decimals": 2,              # Number of decimal places for tooltip
    "legend": True,                # Colour axis key enabled or not
    "datalabels": True,            # Show values in each cell. Defaults True when less than 20 samples.
    "height": 500                  # The default height of the interactive plot, in pixels
}
```

The colour stops are a bit special and can be used to define a custom colour
scheme. These should be defined as a list of lists, with a number between 0 and 1
and a HTML colour. The default is `RdYlBu` from [ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/):

```python
pconfig = {
    "colstops": [
        [0, "#313695"],
        [0.1, "#4575b4"],
        [0.2, "#74add1"],
        [0.3, "#abd9e9"],
        [0.4, "#e0f3f8"],
        [0.5, "#ffffbf"],
        [0.6, "#fee090"],
        [0.7, "#fdae61"],
        [0.8, "#f46d43"],
        [0.9, "#d73027"],
        [1, "#a50026"],
    ]
}
```

## Interactive / Flat image plots

Note that the all plotting functions except for `table` can generate both interactive
JavaScript-powered report plots _and_ flat image plots. This choice is made
depending on the presence of the `--flat` (`config.plots_flat`) flag.

Note that both plot types should come out looking pretty much identical. If
you spot something that's missing in the flat image plots, let me know.

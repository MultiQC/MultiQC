# EDITED IN A PR Introduction

:::info
This pull-request tests whether Netlify deploy previews are working!

MultiQC is a reporting tool that parses summary statistics from results and log files
generated by other bioinformatics tools. MultiQC doesn't run other tools for you -
it's designed to be placed at the end of analysis pipelines or to be run manually
when you've finished running your tools.

When you launch MultiQC, it recursively searches through any provided file paths
and finds files that it recognises. It parses relevant information from these and
generates a single stand-alone HTML report file. It also saves a directory of data
files with all parsed data for further downstream use.

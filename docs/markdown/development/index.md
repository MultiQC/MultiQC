# Developing with MultiQC

MultiQC was built to be customisable and extensible.
Together with its free and open-source nature, this has allowed
the bioinformatics community to add support for many tools over the years.
It also allows users to fine tune how MultiQC works, to best suit their situation.

This section of the docs leads you through how to work with MultiQC development -
primarily building new modules to support output from new tools, but also
to do with writing custom report templates and plugins that can do just about anything!

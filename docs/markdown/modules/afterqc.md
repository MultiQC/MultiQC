  Automatic Filtering, Trimming, Error Removing and Quality Control for fastq data.
---

The AfterQC module parses results generated by
[AfterQC](https://github.com/OpenGene/AfterQC). AfterQC can simply go through all fastq files in a folder and then output three folders: good, bad and QC folders, which contains good reads, bad reads and the QC results of each fastq file/pair.

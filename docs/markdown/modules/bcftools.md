#### Collapse complementary substitutions

In non-strand-specific data, reporting the total numbers of occurences for both changes
in a comlementary pair - like `A>C` and `T>G` - might not bring any additional information.
To collapse such statistics in the substitutions plot, you can add the following section into
[your configuration](https://docs.seqera.io/multiqc/getting_started/config):

```yaml
bcftools:
  collapse_complementary_changes: true
```

MultiQC will sum up all complementary changes and show only `A>*` and `C>*` substitutions
in the resulting plot.

### File search patterns

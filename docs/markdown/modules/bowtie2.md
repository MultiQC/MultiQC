Results from both Bowtie 2 and HISAT2, tools for aligning reads against a reference genome

[http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/), [https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/)
:::

The module parses results generated by [Bowtie 2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/)
and [HISAT2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/), ultrafast and memory-efficient tools for aligning
sequencing reads to long reference sequences. Unfortunately, both tools have identical log output by default,
so it is impossible to distinguish which tool was used.

Please note that the Bowtie 2 and HISAT2 logs are difficult to parse as they don't contain
much extra information (such as what the input data was). A typical log looks like this:

```
314537 reads; of these:
  314537 (100.00%) were paired; of these:
    111016 (35.30%) aligned concordantly 0 times
    193300 (61.46%) aligned concordantly exactly 1 time
    10221 (3.25%) aligned concordantly >1 times
    ----
    111016 pairs aligned concordantly 0 times; of these:
      11377 (10.25%) aligned discordantly 1 time
    ----
    99639 pairs aligned 0 times concordantly or discordantly; of these:
      199278 mates make up the pairs; of these:
        112779 (56.59%) aligned 0 times
        85802 (43.06%) aligned exactly 1 time
        697 (0.35%) aligned >1 times
82.07% overall alignment rate
```

The logs are from `STDERR` - some pipelines (such as [Cluster Flow](http://clusterflow.io))
print the command before this, so MultiQC looks to see if this can be recognised in the same
file. If not, it takes the filename as the sample name.

Bowtie 2 and HISAT2 are used by other tools too, so if your log file contains the word
`bisulfite`, MultiQC will assume that this is actually Bismark and ignore the Bowtie 2 or HISAT2 logs.

### File search patterns

```yaml
bowtie2:
  contents: "reads; of these:"
  exclude_contents:
    - bisulfite
    - HiC-Pro
  shared: true
```

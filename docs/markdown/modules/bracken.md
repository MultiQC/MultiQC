This module works with Bracken output files that resemble Kraken reports. They look like the following:

```tsv
100.00      1188381 0       R       1       root
100.00      1188380 0       R1      131567    cellular organisms
100.00      1188328 0       D       2           Bacteria
99.99       1188317 0       P       1224          Proteobacteria
99.99       1188308 0       C       1236            Gammaproteobacteria
99.99       1188285 0       O       91347             Enterobacterales
99.98       1188147 0       F       543                 Enterobacteriaceae
```

The main assumption to tell Bracken reports from Kraken is that the former don't have
an "unassigned" category at the head of the file, and instead start with "root".

A bar graph is generated identical to that of Kraken.

### File search patterns

```yaml
bracken:
  contents_re: ^(\d{1,3}\.\d{1,2})\t(\d+)\t(\d+)\t((\d+)\t(\d+)\t)?([URDKPCOFGS-]\d{0,2})\t(\d+)(\s+)root
  num_lines: 1
```

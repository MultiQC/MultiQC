PacBio tool that generates highly accurate single-molecule consensus reads (HiFi Reads)

[https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/ccs](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/ccs)
:::

CCS takes multiple subreads of the same SMRTbell molecule and combines them
using a statistical model to produce one highly accurate consensus sequence,
also called HiFi read, with base quality values. This tool powers the Circular
Consensus Sequencing workflow in SMRT Link.

The module summarizes the main information useful for QC, including:

- sequencing metrics
- mapping metrics
- estimated number of cells and reads / cell
- UMI counts
- mean detect genes per cell
- antibody cell counts and distribution

Note that information such as clustering and differential expression are not reported.

The input files are web summaries generated by Cell Ranger. Expected file names are `*web_summary.html`.
Sample IDs are parsed directly from the reports and the module will automatically recognize if they are
generated from VDJ or count analysis.

If present in the original report, any warning is reported as well.

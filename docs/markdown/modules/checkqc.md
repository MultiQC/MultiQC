Checks a set of quality criteria against an Illumina runfolder

[https://github.com/Molmed/checkQC](https://github.com/Molmed/checkQC)
:::

The module parses a CheckQC JSON file, so make sure to use CheckQC with the `--json` flag and collect the stdout in a file.

### File search patterns

```yaml
checkqc:
  contents: instrument_and_reagent_type
  fn: "*.json"
```

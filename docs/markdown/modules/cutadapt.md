Finds and removes adapter sequences, primers, poly-A tails, and other types of unwanted sequences

[https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/)
:::

This module should be able to parse logs from a wide range of versions of Cutadapt.
It works with both the regular Cutadapt report output and also with
[JSON reports (`--json`)](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide.html#json-report).

Although the module parsing code works with very old log files, if you are working with
ancient versions (such as v1.2) you may need to change the search pattern to the following:

```yaml
sp:
  cutadapt:
    contents: "cutadapt version"
```

See the [module search patterns](https://docs.seqera.io/multiqc/getting_started/config#module-search-patterns)
section of the MultiQC documentation for more information.

The module also understands logs saved by Trim Galore, which contain cutadapt logs.

### File search patterns

```yaml
cutadapt:
  - contents: This is cutadapt
    num_lines: 100
  - contents: Cutadapt report
    fn: "*.json"
```

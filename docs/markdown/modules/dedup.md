:::

By default, tables show read counts in thousands.
To customise this, you can set the following MultiQC config variables:

```yaml
ancient_read_count_prefix: "K"
ancient_read_count_desc: "thousands"
ancient_read_count_multiplier: 0.001
```

### File search patterns

```yaml
dedup:
  contents: '"tool_name": "DeDup"'
  fn: '*.json'
  num_lines: 20
```

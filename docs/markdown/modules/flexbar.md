---

[Flexbar](https://github.com/seqan/flexbar) preprocesses high-throughput sequencing data
efficiently. It demultiplexes barcoded runs and removes adapter sequences.
Moreover, trimming and filtering features are provided.
Flexbar increases read mapping rates and improves genome as well as transcriptome assemblies.

Supported tools:

- `AnalyzeSaturationMutagenesis`
- `BaseRecalibrator`
- `VariantEval`

#### AnalyzeSaturationMutagenesis

[AnalyzeSaturationMutagenesis](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/4404604903451-AnalyzeSaturationMutagenesis-BETA-)
is a (beta!) tool for counting variants in saturation mutagenesis experiments. It accepts mapped reads and a reference sequence and outputs
a number of files for further analysis.

#### BaseRecalibrator

[BaseRecalibrator](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/tooldocs/current/org_broadinstitute_gatk_tools_walkers_bqsr_BaseRecalibrator.php)
is a tool for detecting systematic errors in read base quality scores of aligned high-throughput
sequencing reads. It outputs a base quality score recalibration table that can be used in
conjunction with the
[PrintReads](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/tooldocs/current/org_broadinstitute_gatk_tools_walkers_readutils_PrintReads.php)
tool to recalibrate base quality scores.

#### VariantEval

[VariantEval](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/gatkdocs/current/org_broadinstitute_gatk_tools_walkers_varianteval_VariantEval.php)
is a general-purpose tool for variant evaluation. It gives information about percentage of
variants in dbSNP, genotype concordance, Ti/Tv ratios and a lot more.

The GoPeaks module parses logs generated by [GoPeaks](https://github.com/maxsonBraunLab/gopeaks), a program used to call peaks in CUT&TAG/CUT&RUN datasets. GoPeaks uses a binomial distribution to model the read counts in sliding windows across the genome and calculate peak regions that are enriched over the background.

The GoPeaks MultiQC module recognizes files with the `*_gopeaks.json` suffix (which is the default behavior), and will report the number of peaks called per sample via the general table and the bar plot.

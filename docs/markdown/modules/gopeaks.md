Calls peaks in CUT&TAG/CUT&RUN datasets

[https://github.com/maxsonBraunLab/gopeaks](https://github.com/maxsonBraunLab/gopeaks)
:::

Gopeaks uses a binomial distribution to model the read counts in sliding windows across
the genome and calculate peak regions that are enriched over the background.

The module recognizes files with the `*_gopeaks.json` suffix (which is the default behavior), and will report
the number of peaks called per sample via the general table and the bar plot.

### File search patterns

```yaml
gopeaks:
  fn: "*_gopeaks.json"
```

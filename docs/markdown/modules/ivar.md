Functions for viral amplicon-based sequencing

:::

This module parses the output from the `ivar trim` command and creates a table view.
Both output from V1 and V2 of the tool are supported and parsed accordingly.

### File search patterns

```yaml
ivar/trim:
  contents: Number of references
  num_lines: 8
```

Identifies transcription factor binding sites in ChIP-seq data

[https://macs3-project.github.io/MACS/](https://macs3-project.github.io/MACS/)
:::

MACS2 _(Model-based Analysis of ChIP-Seq)_ is a tool for identifying transcript
factor binding sites. MACS captures the influence of genome complexity to
evaluate the significance of enriched ChIP regions.

The module reads the `*_peaks.xls` results files and prints the redundancy rates and number of peaks
found in the General Statistics table. Numerous additional values are parsed and saved to
`multiqc_data/multiqc_macs2.txt`.

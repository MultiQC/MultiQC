Viral genome alignment, clade assignment, mutation calling, and quality checks

[https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade](https://github.com/nextstrain/nextclade)
:::

Nextclade assigns input sequences to SARS-Cov-2 clades based on differences between the input sequences
and [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/) reference sequences. In addition, it judges the validity of
the samples by performing several quality control checks on the input sequences.

Calculating statistics from FASTQ, BAM, and VCF

[https://github.com/imgag/ngs-bits](https://github.com/imgag/ngs-bits)
:::

The ngs-bits module parses XML output generated for several tools in the ngs-bits collection:

- [ReadQC](https://github.com/imgag/ngs-bits/blob/master/doc/tools/ReadQC.md) for statistics on FASTQ files,
- [MappingQC](https://github.com/imgag/ngs-bits/blob/master/doc/tools/MappingQC.md) for statistics on BAM files,
- [SampleGender](https://github.com/imgag/ngs-bits/blob/master/doc/tools/SampleGender.md) for gender prediction based on sequencing data.

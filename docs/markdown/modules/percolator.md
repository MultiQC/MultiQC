:::

The module assumes that the Percolator output file is named `*percolator_feature_weights.tsv`.
Make sure to run it using:

```
percolator ... > samples.percolator_feature_weights.tsv
```

The module accepts one configuration option:
 - `group_to_feature`: A dictionary mapping group names to feature names (empty per default), e.g. in `multiqc_config.yaml`:

```yaml
percolator:
  group_to_feature:
    psm_file_combined: [MS:1002255, MS:1002252]
    ms2pip: [ionb_min_abs_diff, iony_min_abs_diff]
    deeplc: [rt_diff]
```

### File search patterns

```yaml
percolator:
  fn: '*percolator_feature_weights.tsv'
```

description: Reference-free quality control for Hi-C DNA sequencing libraries
---

qc3C allows researchers to assess the fraction of read-pairs within a Hi-C library that are a product of proximity ligation -- in effect the Hi-C signal strength.
Using a k-mer based approach, signal strength is inferred directly from reads and therefore no reference is required.
Reference based assessment is also available and can provide further details.

With this information in hand, researchers are able to decide how much sequencing will be needed to achieve their experimental aims.

:::

Ribo-TISH is a tool for identifying translated ORFs from Ribo-seq data.
This module parses the `*_qual.txt` output files to visualize reading frame
quality metrics across different read lengths.

The module creates one of two visualizations:
1. A stacked bar chart showing the proportion of reads in each reading frame
   (Frame 0, 1, 2) for read lengths 25-34nt
2. A heatmap showing the percentage distribution of read lengths within each sample

### File search patterns

```yaml
ribotish/qual:
  fn: '*_qual.txt'
  num_lines: 10
```

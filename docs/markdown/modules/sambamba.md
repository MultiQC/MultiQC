It is functionally similar to Samtools, but the source code is written in the D Language. It allows for faster performance while still being easy to use.

Supported commands:

- `markdup`

#### markdup

This module parses key phrases in the output log files to find duplicate +
unique reads and then calculates duplicate rate per sample. It will work for both
single and paired-end data. The absolute number of reads by type are displayed
in a stacked bar plot, and duplicate rates are in the general statistics table.

Duplicate rates are calculated as follows:

#### Paired end

> `duplicate_rate = duplicateReads / (sortedEndPairs * 2 + singleEnds - singleUnmatchedPairs) * 100`

#### Single end

> `duplicate_rate = duplicateReads / singleEnds * 100`

If Sambamba Markdup is invoked using Snakemake, the following bare-bones
rule should work fine:

```
rule markdup:
  input:
    "data/align/{sample}.bam"
  output:
    "data/markdup/{sample}.markdup.bam"
  log:
    "data/logs/{sample}.log"
  shell:
    "sambamba markdup {input} {output} > {log} 2>&1"
```

### File search patterns

```yaml
sambamba/markdup:
  contents: finding positions of the duplicate reads in the file
  num_lines: 50
```

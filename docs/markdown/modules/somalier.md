  Somalier does fast genotype :: pedigree correspondence checks
  from BAM/CRAM/VCF
---

Somalier can be used to find sample swaps or duplicates in cancer
projects, where there is often no jointly-called VCF across samples.

It is also extremely efficient and so can be used to find all-vs-all
relatedness estimates for thousands of samples.

It also outputs information on sex, depth, heterozgyosity, and ancestry
to be use for general QC.

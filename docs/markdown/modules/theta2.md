The module plots the % germline and % tumour subclone for each sample.
Note that each sample can have multiple maximum likelihood solutions - the MultiQC
module plots proportions for the first one in the results file (`*.BEST.results`).
Also note that if there are more than 5 tumour subclones, their percentages are summed.

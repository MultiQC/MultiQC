Estimates tumour purity and clonal / subclonal copy number

[http://compbio.cs.brown.edu/projects/theta/](http://compbio.cs.brown.edu/projects/theta/)
:::

The module plots the % germline and % tumour subclone for each sample.
Note that each sample can have multiple maximum likelihood solutions - the MultiQC
module plots proportions for the first one in the results file (`*.BEST.results`).
Also note that if there are more than 5 tumour subclones, their percentages are summed.

### File search patterns

```yaml
theta2:
  fn: "*.BEST.results"
```

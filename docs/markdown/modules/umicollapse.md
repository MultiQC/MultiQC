Algorithms for efficiently collapsing reads with Unique Molecular Identifiers

[https://github.com/Daniel-Liu-c0deb0t/UMICollapse](https://github.com/Daniel-Liu-c0deb0t/UMICollapse)
:::

Sample names are extracted from log files if possible. In logs, the command
line arguments are printed, which must have both the input and output
file paths.

```
umicollapse bam -i SRR19887568.sorted.bam -o SRR19887568.umi_dedup.sorted.bam
Arguments	[bam, -i, SRR19887568.sorted.bam, -o, SRR19887568.umi_dedup.sorted.bam]
```

`umicollapse` requires both -i and -o flags as valid file paths. Process
substitution is not supported currently by umicollapse, but in case it is
used for the -i flag, we fallback to the log file name.

### File search patterns

```yaml
umicollapse:
  contents: "UMI collapsing finished in "
  num_lines: 100
```

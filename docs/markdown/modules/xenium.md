<p>Spatial transcriptomics platform from 10x Genomics that provides subcellular resolution.</p>

[https://www.10xgenomics.com/platforms/xenium](https://www.10xgenomics.com/platforms/xenium)
:::

Xenium is a spatial transcriptomics platform from 10x Genomics that provides subcellular resolution.

NOTE: parsing huge files is not an intended MultiQC usage. By default, MultiQC will ignore the `*.parquet` files
as they are gigabyte-sized. To enable parsing those, make sure to have this line in your config:

```
log_filesize_limit: 5000000000 # 5GB
```

### File search patterns

```yaml
xenium/cell_feature_matrix:
  fn: cell_feature_matrix.h5
xenium/cells:
  fn: cells.parquet
xenium/experiment:
  fn: experiment.xenium
  num_lines: 50
xenium/metrics:
  contents: num_cells_detected
  fn: metrics_summary.csv
  num_lines: 5
xenium/transcripts:
  fn: transcripts.parquet
```

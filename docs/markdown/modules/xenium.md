<p>Spatial transcriptomics platform from 10x Genomics that provides subcellular resolution.</p>

[https://www.10xgenomics.com/platforms/xenium](https://www.10xgenomics.com/platforms/xenium)
:::

Xenium is a spatial transcriptomics platform from 10x Genomics that provides subcellular resolution.

:::note
Parsing huge files is not an intended MultiQC usage. By default, MultiQC will ignore the `*.parquet` files
as they are gigabyte-sized. To enable parsing those, make sure to have this line in your config:

```
log_filesize_limit: 5000000000 # 5GB
```

:::

The MultiQC module is tested with outputs from xenium-3.x, older versions of xenium output are
not supported and may even cause MultiQC to crash (see https://github.com/MultiQC/MultiQC/issues/3344).

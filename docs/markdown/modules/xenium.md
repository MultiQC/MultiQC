<p>Spatial transcriptomics platform from 10x Genomics that provides subcellular resolution.</p>

[https://www.10xgenomics.com/platforms/xenium](https://www.10xgenomics.com/platforms/xenium)
:::

Xenium is a spatial transcriptomics platform from 10x Genomics that provides subcellular resolution.

:::note
This module provides basic quality metrics from the Xenium pipeline (total transcripts, cells detected,
transcript assignment rates, and median genes per cell).

For advanced visualizations including:

- Transcript quality distributions by gene category
- Cell and nucleus area distributions
- Field-of-view quality plots
- Segmentation method breakdown
- Transcripts per gene distributions

Install the [multiqc-xenium-extra](https://pypi.org/project/multiqc-xenium-extra/) plugin:

```bash
pip install multiqc multiqc-xenium-extra
```

The plugin automatically adjusts the log filesize limit to parse large Xenium files (`.parquet` and `.h5`),
so you don't need to manually configure `log_filesize_limit` in your MultiQC config when using the plugin.
:::

The MultiQC module is tested with outputs from xenium-3.x, older versions of xenium output are
not supported and may even cause MultiQC to crash (see https://github.com/MultiQC/MultiQC/issues/3344).

There are two versions of this software: [bcl2fastq](https://support.illumina.com/downloads/bcl2fastq_conversion_software_184.html) for MiSeq and HiSeq
sequencing systems running RTA versions earlier than 1.8, and [bcl2fastq2](https://support.illumina.com/downloads/bcl2fastq-conversion-software-v2-18.html)
for Illumina sequencing systems running RTA version 1.18.54 and above.
This module currently only covers output from the latter.

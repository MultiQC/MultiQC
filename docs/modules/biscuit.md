The BISCUIT module parses logs generated by
[BISCUIT](https://github.com/huishenlab/biscuit) and the quality control script,
QC.sh, included with the BISCUIT software.

Note - as of MultiQC v1.9, the module supports only BISCUIT version v0.3.16 and onwards.
If you have BISCUIT data from before this, please use MultiQC v1.8.

### Insert Size Distribution

The second tab of this plot uses the config option `read_count_multiplier`,
so if millions of reads is not useful for your data you can customise this.

See [Number base (multiplier)](https://multiqc.info/docs/#number-base-multiplier)
in the documentation.

This MultiQC modules parses the report generated by Bustools inspect, and expects the file to be named `inspect.json`. This is the default naming pattern when you make use of the [kallisto-bustools wrapper](https://www.kallistobus.tools/). The sample name is set as the name of the directory containing the file. For the rest, this module should work in exactly the same way as all other MultiQC modules.

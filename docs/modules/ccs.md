The CCS module parses the report file generated by
[ccs](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/ccs), a PacBio tool to generate
highly accurate single-molecule consensus reads (HiFi Reads).

CCS takes multiple subreads of the same SMRTbell molecule and combines them
using a statistical model to produce one highly accurate consensus sequence,
also called HiFi read, with base quality values. This tool powers the Circular
Consensus Sequencing workflow in SMRT Link.

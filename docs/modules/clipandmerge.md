    adapter clipping and read merging in ancient DNA analysis

An application to clip adapter sequences and merge reads in ancient DNA analysis. Note, that versions < 1.7.8 use the basename of the file path to distinguish samples, whereas newer versions produce logfiles with a sample identifer that gets parsed by MultiQC.

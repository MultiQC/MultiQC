Cluster Flow is a simple and flexible bioinformatics pipeline tool.
It's designed to be quick and easy to install, with flexible configuration
and simple customization.

Cluster Flow easy enough to set up and use for non-bioinformaticians
(given a basic knowledge of the command line), and it's simplicity
makes it great for low to medium throughput analyses.

The MultiQC module for Cluster Flow parses `*_clusterflow.txt` logs
and finds consensus commands executed by modules in each pipeline run.

The Cluster Flow `*.run` files are also parsed and pipeline information
shown (some basic statistics plus the pipeline steps / params used).

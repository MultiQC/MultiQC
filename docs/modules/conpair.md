    Conpair estimates concordance and contamination for tumourâ€“normal pairs
---

[Conpair](https://github.com/nygenome/Conpair) is a fast and robust method dedicated for human tumour-normal studies to perform concordance verification (= samples coming from the same individual), as well as cross-individual contamination level estimation in whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing experiments.

Analysis of genome editing outcomes from deep sequencing data
---

[CRISPResso2](http://crispresso2.pinellolab.org/) is a software pipeline
designed to enable rapid and intuitive interpretation of genome editing
experiments. Briefly, CRISPResso2:

 * aligns sequencing reads to a reference sequence
 * quantifies insertions, mutations and deletions to determine whether a read is modified or unmodified by genome editing
 * summarizes editing results in intuitive plots and datasets

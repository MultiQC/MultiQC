The Cutadapt module parses results generated by
[Cutadapt](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/),
a tool to find and remove adapter sequences, primers, poly-A
tails and other types of unwanted sequence from your high-throughput
sequencing reads.

This module should be able to parse logs from a wide range of versions of Cutadapt.
It's been tested with log files from v1.2.1, 1.6 and 1.8. Note that you will need
to change the search pattern for very old log files (such as v.1.2) with the following
MultiQC config:
```yaml
sp:
    cutadapt:
        contents: 'cutadapt version'
```
See the [module search patterns](http://multiqc.info/docs/#module-search-patterns)
section of the MultiQC documentation for more information.

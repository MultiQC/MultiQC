Improved Duplicate Removal for merged/collapsed reads in ancient DNA analysis

By default, tables show read counts in thousands.
To customise this, you can set the following MultiQC config variables:

```yaml
ancient_read_count_prefix: 'K'
ancient_read_count_desc: 'thousands'
ancient_read_count_multiplier: 0.001
```

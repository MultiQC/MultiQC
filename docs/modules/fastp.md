Description: >
    An ultra-fast all-in-one FASTQ preprocessor
---

The Fastp module parses results generated by
[Fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp). Fastp can simply go through all fastq files in a folder and perform a series of quality control and filtering. Quality control and reporting are displayed both before and after filtering, allowing for a clear depiction of the consequences of the filtering process. Notably, the latter can be conducted on a variety of paramaters including quality scores, length, as well as the presence of adapters, polyG, or polyX tailing.

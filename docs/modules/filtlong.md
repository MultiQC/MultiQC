[Filtlong](https://github.com/rrwick/Filtlong) is a tool for filtering long reads by quality.
It can take a set of long reads and produce a smaller, better subset. It uses both read length (longer is better) and read identity (higher is better) when choosing which reads pass the filter.

The module takes summary statistics of number of long reads filtered and displays them in the General Stats table.

Description: Recover relative lineage abundances from mixed SARS-CoV-2 samples.
---

Freyja is a tool to recover relative lineage abundances from mixed SARS-CoV-2 samples from a sequencing dataset and uses lineage-determining mutational "barcodes" derived from the UShER global phylogenetic tree to solve the constrained (unit sum, non-negative) de-mixing problem.

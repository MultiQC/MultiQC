The gfastats module parses results generated by
[gfastats](http://www.htslib.org),
is a single fast and exhaustive tool for summary statistics and simultaneous _fa_ (fasta, fastq, gfa [.gz]) genome assembly file manipulation..

Supported commands:

- `--stats -t`

### --stats

The `gfastats --stats` is the default command and prints its results to standard
out (no consistent file name) and has no header lines
(no way to recognise from content of file).
Because of this, you _must_ name your output files so that they end in `.gfastats.tsv` or `.gfastats.csv` so that MultiQC can find them.

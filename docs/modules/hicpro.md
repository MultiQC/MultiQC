Description: >
  HiC-Pro is an optimized and flexible pipeline for Hi-C data processing.
---

The HiC-Pro module parses results generated by
[HiC-Pro](https://github.com/nservant/HiC-Pro), a tool for efficient processing and quality control of Hi-C data.

Please note - because this module shares sample identifiers across multiple files,
the `--fn_as_s_name` / `config.use_filename_as_sample_name` functionality has been disabled and has no effect.

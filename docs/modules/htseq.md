HTSeq is a general purpose Python package that provides infrastructure to
process data from high-throughput sequencing assays. `htseq-count` is a tool
that is part of the main HTSeq package - it takes a file with aligned sequencing
reads, plus a list of genomic features and counts how many reads map to each feature.

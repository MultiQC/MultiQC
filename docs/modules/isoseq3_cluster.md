Description: >
	isoseq3 cluster is a PacBio tool that cluster CCS using a single linkage method to generates highly accurate 
	single-molecule consensus reads (HiFi Reads).
---

The isoseq3 cluster module parses the report file generated by
[isoseq3 cluster](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/IsoSeq/blob/master/isoseq-clustering.md#step-4---clustering).
It gathers similar CCS using a single linkage method and generates highly accurate single-molecule consensus reads (HiFi Reads).

Isoseq3 cluster take as input the CCS reads after primer validation and removal
([lima](https://github.com/pacificbiosciences/barcoding/)), poly(A) tail trimming, concatemer detection and removal
([isoseq3 refine](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/IsoSeq/blob/master/isoseq-clustering.md#step-3---refine)).

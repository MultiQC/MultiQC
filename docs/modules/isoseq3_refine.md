Description: >
	Isoseq3 refine is a PacBio tool that refine full length highly accurate single-molecule
	consensus reads (HiFi Reads).
---

The isoseq3 refine module parses the report file generated by
[isoseq3 refine](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/IsoSeq/blob/master/isoseq-clustering.md#step-3---refine), a PacBio tool to generate
refined highly accurate single-molecule consensus reads (HiFi Reads).
It detects poly(A) and trim it from CCS sequence.
CCS without poly(A) tails or that have been detected has concatemer are discarded.

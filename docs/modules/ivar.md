iVar is a computational package that contains functions broadly useful for viral amplicon-based sequencing.

This module parses the output from the `ivar trim` command and creates a table view. Both output from V1 and V2 of the tool are supported and parsed accordingly. The executable used can easily be installed from the BioConda channel using `conda install -c bioconda ivar=1.2` for example.

Description: >
    Fast genome and metagenome distance estimation using MinHash.

The mash module parses results generated by the distance function in
[MASH](https://mash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Mash reduces sequences to sketches, which are then used to estimate a pairwise mutation distance and P-value.

Although Mash can used to determine the distance of virtually any two sequences,
this module is for `P-value = 0` results when compared to the prepared [RefSeq sketch](refseq.genomes.k21.s1000.msh)
with a final file ending in `sample*mashdist.txt`.

```
mash dist refseq.genomes.k21.s1000.msh reads.fastq.msh > sample_mashdist.txt
```

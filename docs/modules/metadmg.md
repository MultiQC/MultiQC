  metaDMG-cpp is a fast and efficient method for assigning reads to LCA and to estimate damage rates in ancient DNA data.
---

It relies on a commonly used alignment files formats bam/sam/sam.gz and can calculate
degree of damage from read data mapped against a single as well as multiple genomes.
It is especially relevant for data where data have been mapped against multiple
reference genomes or to speed up analysis for damage estimation for a single genome.

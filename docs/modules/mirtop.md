  Annotates miRNAs and isomiRs and compute general statistics in mirGFF3 format
---

This tool is dedicated to the creation and management of miRNA alignment output using the standardized
GFF3 format (see [miRTop/mirGFF3](https://github.com/miRTop/mirGFF3)).
A unified miRNA alignment format allows to easily compare the output of different alignment tools.

Currently, mirtop can convert into mirGFF3 the outputs of commonly used pipelines, such as seqbuster,
isomiR-SEA, sRNAbench, Prost! as well as BAM files.

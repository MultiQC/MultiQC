description: Command line tool to annotate miRNAs with a standard mirna/isomir naming
---

This tool is dedicated to the creation and management of miRNA alignment output using the standardized GFF3 format (<https://github.com/miRTop/mirGFF3>).
A unified miRNA alignment format allows to easily compare the output of different alignement tools.

Currently, mirtop can convert into mirGFF3 the outputs of commonly used pipelines, such as seqbuster, isomiR-SEA, sRNAbench, Prost! as well as BAM files.

The nanostat module parses text output generated by
[NanoStat](https://github.com/wdecoster/nanostat/), a program for summarising results of sequencing
on Oxford Nanopore methods (MinION, PromethION etc.). Note that the program is deprecated now, however, the tools from the [NanoPack family](https://github.com/wdecoster/nanopack/) (NanoPlot, NanoComp) still call the same code indirectly.

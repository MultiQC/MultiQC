description: >
  Calculate various statistics from a long read sequencing dataset in FastQ, BAM or albacore
  sequencing summary format (supports NanoPack; NanoPlot, NanoComp).

The nanostat module parses text output generated by
[NanoStat](https://github.com/wdecoster/nanostat/), a program for summarising results of sequencing
on Oxford Nanopore methods (MinION, PromethION etc.).

Note that the program is deprecated now, however, the tools from the [NanoPack family](https://github.com/wdecoster/nanopack/) (NanoPlot, NanoComp) still call the same code indirectly.

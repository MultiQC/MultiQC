Description: Viral genome alignment, clade assignment, mutation calling, and quality checks

Nextclade assigns input sequences to SARS-Cov-2 clades based on differences between the input sequences and [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org/) reference sequences. In addition, it judges the validity of the samples by performing several quality control checks on the input sequences.

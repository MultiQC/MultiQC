The ngs-bits module parses XML output generated for several tools in the ngs-bits collection:
[ReadQC](https://github.com/imgag/ngs-bits/blob/master/doc/tools/ReadQC.md), for statistics on FASTQ
files, [MappingQC](https://github.com/imgag/ngs-bits/blob/master/doc/tools/MappingQC.md), for
statistics on BAM files.

`ngsderive` is a forensic analysis tool useful in backwards computing information from next-generation sequencing data. Notably, results are provided as a 'best guess' â€” the tool does not claim 100% accuracy and results should be considered with that understanding. Please see the <a href='https://github.com/claymcleod/ngsderive/#ngsderive'>documentation</a> for more information.

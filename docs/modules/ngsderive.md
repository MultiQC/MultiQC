Description: finds information about sequencing libraries by backwards computing sequencing data.

`ngsderive` is a forensic analysis tool useful in backwards computing information from next-generation sequencing data. Notably, results are provided as a 'best guess' â€” the tool does not claim 100% accuracy and results should be considered with that understanding.
Please see the [documentation](https://stjudecloud.github.io/ngsderive) for more information.

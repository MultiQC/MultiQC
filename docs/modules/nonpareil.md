  Estimate metagenomic coverage and sequence diversity.
---

Nonpareil uses the redundancy of the reads in a metagenomic dataset to estimate
the average coverage and predict the ammount of sequences that will be required
to achieve "nearly complete coverage", defined as ≥95% or ≥99% average coverage. 

Since Nonpareil is written in `R` and there is no output with the model information,
this module parses a `JSON` file that needs to be generated by the user. For more
info on how to generate this file, check `nonpareil` [snakemake plot wrapper](https://snakemake-wrappers.readthedocs.io/en/latest/wrappers/nonpareil/plot.html).

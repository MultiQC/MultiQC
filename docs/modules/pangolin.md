description: Pangolin uses variant calls to assign SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences to global lineages.
---

Pangolin _(Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak LINeages)_ was developed to implement
the dynamic nomenclature of SARS-CoV-2 lineages, known as the Pango nomenclature.

It allows a user to assign a SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence the most likely lineage (Pango lineage) to SARS-CoV-2 query sequences.

You can find the Panogolin documentation here: <https://cov-lineages.org/pangolin.html>

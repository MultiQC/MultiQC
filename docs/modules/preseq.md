The Preseq module parses results generated by
[Preseq](http://smithlabresearch.org/software/preseq/),
a tool that estimates the complexity of a library, showing how many additional
unique reads are sequenced for increasing total read count.

Preseq estimation curves can sometimes be huge, causing the x-axis to stretch
well up into the thousands of millions of molecules. This can make the plot
difficult to interpret. It also includes a lot of data in the reports, which
can unnecessarily inflate report file sizes. To avoid this, MultiQC trims
back the x axis until one of the datasets shows 90% of its maximum y-value
(unique molecules).

To disable this feature and show all of the data, add the following to your
MultiQC configuration:
```yaml
preseq:
    notrim: true
```

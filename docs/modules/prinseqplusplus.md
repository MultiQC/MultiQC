Description: >
  PRINSEQ++ is a C++ implementation of the prinseq-lite.pl program.
---

PRINSEQ++ can be used to filter, reformat or trim genomic and metagenomic sequence data. It is 5X faster than prinseq-lite.pl and uses less RAM thanks to the use of multi-threading and the cboost libraries. It can read and write compressed (gzip) files, drastically reducing the use of hard drive.

This module requires that PRINSEQ++ has been run with -VERBOSE 1, and assumes the file name of the log is that of the sample name.

Description: A purity, ploidy and copy number estimator for whole genome tumor data
---

Purple combines B-allele frequency (BAF), read depth ratios, somatic variants and
structural variant breakpoints to estimate the purity and copy number profile
of a tumor sample, and also predicts gender, the MSI status, tumor mutational
load and burden, clonality and the whole genome duplication status.

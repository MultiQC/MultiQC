Description: >
    A Quality Assessment Tool for Genome Assemblies by
    the Center for Algorithmic Biotechnology.
---

[QUAST](http://quast.bioinf.spbau.ru/) evaluates genome assemblies by
computing various metrics, including

* N50, length for which the collection of all contigs of that length or
  longer covers at least 50% of assembly length
* NG50, where length of the reference genome is being covered
* NA50 and NGA50, where aligned blocks instead of contigs are taken
* Misassemblies, misassembled and unaligned contigs or contigs bases
* Genes and operons covered

The QUAST MultiQC module parses the `report.tsv` files generated by
QUAST and adds key metrics to the report General Statistics table.
All statistics for all samples are saved to `multiqc_data/multiqc_quast.txt`.

#### MetaQUAST
The QUAST module will also parse output from
[MetaQUAST](http://quast.sourceforge.net/metaquast) runs (`metaquast.py`).

The `combined_reference/report.tsv` file is parsed, and folders
`runs_per_reference` and `not_aligned` are ignored.

If you want to run MultiQC against auxiliary MetaQUAST runs, you must
explicitly pass these files to MultiQC:

```
multiqc runs_per_reference/reference_1/report.tsv
```

Note that you can pass as many file paths to MultiQC as you like
and use glob expansion (eg. `runs_per_reference/*/report.tsv`).

  Fast, efficient RNA-Seq metrics for quality control and process optimization
---

The RSeQC module parses results generated by
[RNA-SeQC](https://github.com/broadinstitute/rnaseqc),
(not to be confused with [RSeQC](http://rseqc.sourceforge.net/),
which MultiQC also supports).

RNA-SeQC is a java program which computes a series of quality
control metrics for RNA-seq data.

This module shows the Spearman correlation heatmap if both
Spearman and Pearson's are found. To plot Pearson's by default instead,
add the following to your MultiQC config file:

```yaml
rna_seqc:
  default_correlation: pearson
```

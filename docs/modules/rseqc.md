The RSeQC module parses results generated by
[RSeQC](http://rseqc.sourceforge.net/),
a package that provides a number of useful modules that can
comprehensively evaluate high throughput RNA-seq data.

Supported scripts:

* `bam_stat`
* `gene_body_coverage`
* `infer_experiment`
* `inner_distance`
* `junction_annotation`
* `junction_saturation`
* `read_distribution`
* `read_duplication`
* `read_gc`

You can choose to hide sections of RSeQC output and customise their order.
To do this, add and customise the following to your MultiQC config file:

```yaml
rseqc_sections:
    - read_distribution
    - gene_body_coverage
    - inner_distance
    - read_gc
    - read_duplication
    - junction_annotation
    - junction_saturation
    - infer_experiment
    - bam_stat
```

Change the order to rearrage sections or remove to hide them from the report.

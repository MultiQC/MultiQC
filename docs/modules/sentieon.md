Description: >
  Sentieon-dnaseq produces many outputs. This module deals with 3 Picard
  equivalents which do not transfer well to MultiQC. The code for each script
  is split into its own file and adds a section to the module output if
  logs are found.
---

The Sentieon module parses output from the Sentieon dna-seq suite of tools,
which themselves are implementations of certain Picard metrics
[Picard](http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/),
a set of Java command line tools for manipulating high-throughput
sequencing data.

Supported commands:

- `InsertSizeMetrics`
- `GcBiasMetrics`
- `AlignmentSummaryMetrics`

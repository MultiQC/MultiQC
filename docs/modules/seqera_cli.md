description: Reports statistics generated by the Seqera Platform CLI.
---

Parses a tar-gz dump containing logs and stats from a Seqera Platform run (e.g.
`runs_SmUkr43Nul49G.tar.gz`). Expects the dump to contain a `workflow.json` file,
along with `workflow-load.json`. Can also parse an uncompressed version of the
dump, that is, a `workflow.json` file and a `workflow-load.json` sitting together
in a directory.

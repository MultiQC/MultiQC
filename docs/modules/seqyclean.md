The SeqyClean module will visualize the results from a [SeqyClean](https://github.com/ibest/seqyclean), a comprehensive preprocessing software pipeline. SeqyClean removes noise from Fastq files to improve de-novo genome assembly and genome mapping.

The module parses the `*SummaryStatistics.tsv` files that results from a SeqyClean cleaning.

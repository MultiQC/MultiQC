The Sickle module parses standard error generated by
[Sickle](https://github.com/najoshi/sickle), a
windowed Adaptive Trimming for fastq files using quality. StdOut can be captured by
directing it to a file e.g. `sickle command 2> sickle_out.log`

The module generates the sample names based on the filenames.

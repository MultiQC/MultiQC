somalier can be used to find sample swaps or duplicates in cancer
projects, where there is often no jointly-called VCF across samples.

It is also extremely efficient and so can be used to find all-vs-all
relatedness estimates for thousands of samples.

It also outputs information on sex, depth, and heterozgyosity to be
use for general QC.

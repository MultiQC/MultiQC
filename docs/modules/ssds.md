The SSDS module parses the reports generated from the SSDS pipeline. 
[SSDS](http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2012/03/20/gr.130583.111.full.pdf). Briefly, read-pairse from SSDS can be categorized as derived from single-stranded or duplex DNA. This report shows some statistics of this parsing process. Data from a second report showing the Signal Portion of Tags (SPoT) at given genomic intervals can also be displayed.

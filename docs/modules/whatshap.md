  WhatsHap is a software for phasing genomic variants using DNA sequencing reads,
  also called read-based phasing or haplotype assembly. It is especially
  suitable for long reads, but works also well with short reads.

The WhatsHap module parses results generated by
[WhatsHap](https://whatshap.readthedocs.io), and is currently restricted to the
output from `whatshap stats --tsv`.

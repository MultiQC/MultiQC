  Xenome is a tool for classifying reads from xenograft sources.  ---

The Xenome module parses results generated by
[Xenome](https://github.com/data61/gossamer/blob/master/docs/xenome.md), and is currently restricted to the
log from `xenome classify`.

In the general stats table, the read fractions within a sample are show.
To show the absolute read counts instead, you can use this config option:

```yaml
xenome:
  show_read_counts: true
```

  Xenome is a tool for classifying reads from xenograft sources.

The Xenome module parses results generated by
[Xenome](https://github.com/data61/gossamer/blob/master/docs/xenome.md), and is currently restricted to the log from `xenome classify`.

**Note** - MultiQC parses the standard out from Xenome, hence one has to redirect
command line output to a file in order to use it with the MultiQC module. Also note
that the tool does not register any sample name information in the output, so MultiQC
attempts to fetch the sample name from the file name by default.

For example, if your Xenome command was:

```sh
xenome classify -P idx --pairs -i in_1.fastq -i in_2.fastq > sample.txt
```

Then the sample name in the report will be `sample`, which is the base name of the file.

    The heatmap is formatted in a similar way as FastQC per base sequence content. The differences are:
    1) The pass/fail flag in the original FastQC module are replaced with a color reflecting the group tag of the samples
    2) Read1 and Read2 is co-plotted and separate by a white band in the heatmap and a red dashed in each individual sample plot.

    The following is a copy of helptext of the FastQC module:
    
    To enable multiple samples to be shown in a single plot, the base composition data
    is shown as a heatmap. The colours represent the balance between the four bases:
    an even distribution should give an even muddy brown colour. Hover over the plot
    to see the percentage of the four bases under the cursor.

    **To see the data as a line plot, as in the original FastQC graph, click on a sample track.**

    From the [FastQC help](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/4%20Per%20Base%20Sequence%20Content.html):

    _Per Base Sequence Content plots out the proportion of each base position in a
    file for which each of the four normal DNA bases has been called._

    _In a random library you would expect that there would be little to no difference
    between the different bases of a sequence run, so the lines in this plot should
    run parallel with each other. The relative amount of each base should reflect
    the overall amount of these bases in your genome, but in any case they should
    not be hugely imbalanced from each other._

    _It's worth noting that some types of library will always produce biased sequence
    composition, normally at the start of the read. Libraries produced by priming
    using random hexamers (including nearly all RNA-Seq libraries) and those which
    were fragmented using transposases inherit an intrinsic bias in the positions
    at which reads start. This bias does not concern an absolute sequence, but instead
    provides enrichement of a number of different K-mers at the 5' end of the reads.
    Whilst this is a true technical bias, it isn't something which can be corrected
    by trimming and in most cases doesn't seem to adversely affect the downstream
    analysis._

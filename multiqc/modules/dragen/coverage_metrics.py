The following code section provides a clean and simple tool for setting configurations:
https://github.com/ewels/MultiQC/blob/master/docs/plots.md#creating-a-table

The SINGLE_HEADER is used to define the common settings for all coverage headers.
'''

    "exclude": True,  # Exclude all headers from the general html table.
}
'''""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The EXTRA_HEADER contains the logical keys of the SINGLE_HEADER. These are just extensions,
but can be used as if they were a part of the SINGLE_HEADER. Extra configurations are not
set by default. Only the SINGLE_HEADER is used as a basis for a header. But you can always
append an extra config(eg hidden_own, exclude) to the SINGLE_HEADER to overcome this issue.

Hints and rules:
- "hidden" is used for own coverage section if "hidden_own" is not provided.

- "exclude" and "exclude_own" may be useful in cases where html size matters.
  Eg. many samples, several regions but only few metrics of interest.

- "order_priority" shall be used only in the METRICS.
  Details are in the corresponding comment below.
'''
EXTRA_HEADER = {
    "hidden_own": None,  # For non-general plots in the coverage section.
    "exclude": None,  # True to exclude metric from the general html table.

    "order_priority": None,  # Used to specify columns' order in all tables.
}
'''"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The composition of each region string is very sensitive.
It has to coincide with the region format in input-CSVs.
Letters must be lower case. No padding(extra spaces) on
the left/right sides. Words must be separated from each
other with a single-space string, that is " ".
'''
WGS = "genome"
QC = "qc coverage region"
BED = "target region"
# The desired regions can be added:
# REGION = "some region"

"""
The REGIONS holds the variables. You can add common region's settings here.
These configs have higher priority than those in the SINGLE_HEADER.
They also overwrite the automatically created ones.
REGIONS is also used to detect actual regions in real data and allow
the special metrics "aligned bases/reads" to have region-specific settings.
So it is a good idea to include all known regions in the dictionary.

The METRICS is the container for abstract representations of the standard metrics.
They are designed to be seen as simple identifiers of the well known metrics.
You can set any possible real/virtual configuration defined in the SINGLE_HEADER.

Some rules:
- You can use the single regions defined above as keys to set
  region-specific configurations for a certain metric.

- "modify" must conform to the following general structure:
  lambda x: (arbitrary expression) if isinstance(x, str) else (math expression)
  The x is either number or string. The latter is some value, which could not be
  converted to int or float. NA for instance. Such values can be modified in the
  (arbitrary expression) if needed. If not then just return the input.

- "order_priority" can be used to define an insertion order of headers.
  Only int and float numbers are valid. The config is used for own and
  general tables.

- The descending precedence of configurations:
  1. Region-specific metric
  2. General metric
  3. General region
  4. Automatically defined settings
  5. Basic configs in the SINGLE_HEADER
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""'''

""" Extra Info:

- If you want to add new metrics, then you could try the following:
  * All characters must be in lower case.
  * No extra padded space on the left and right sides.
  * If tokens (eg words, operators) are separated from each other by a sequence
    of spaces, replace each such sequence with just one single-space string " ".
  * If it still does not work, then you might need to take a look
    at the "make_consistent_metric" and maybe at the "make_user_configs".

- Some "title"s below contain the "&nbsp;" html entity to widen the column's title.
  Otherwise long values can overlap with adjacent values in right columns/rows below.
  Basically it is just a dirty little trick, which can be useful in rare cases.
  These entities will be deleted for the general table, since its columns' titles
  contain extra region suffixes, which make the columns wide enough.

- If you want to use "greater than or equal to" sign, then take a look at these:
    ">="
    &ge;
    ⩾
    ≥
    &#8925;  or  &#x22DD;
    &#8927;  or  &#x22DF;
    &#8829;  or  &#x227D;

  New characters can be added as well.
  Some of them may be more pleasing to your eye than others.

- There is a little harmless bug in the process of MultiQC table creation.
  It might be of interest if you are using the "exclude" config. So,
  if there is only one column in the table, and the "hidden" set to True,
  then the column !AND! the "Configure Columns" button won't be shown.
  Unfortunately there is no simple user-friendly way to extract column's data.
  The column is actually in the html table, but the "display" attribute is set
  to none. "Configure Columns" button is not included in table's div block.

- The "cond_formatting_colours" along with "cond_formatting_rules" can be
  used to put extra colour on values in html tables. The former must be a
  list of dictionaries, where each dictionary shall be a single definition
  of some colour. The latter is a dictionary with colours. Each colour's
  value is a list, which holds dictionaries with ecomparison rules, which
  can be found in the little code block below. Please notice that an insertion
  order of colours in the "cond_formatting_colours" plays an enormous role,
  because the last chosen colour will be used in html.

  The code can be modified in the future, but probably not dramatically.
  So the following description could be useful. At least for some time.

  # This python code is a simplified part of the multiqc/plots/table.py
  # It shows the logical process of defining a colour on some value.
  VAL # The actual single input value. Most likely int or float.
      # It's been modified by the "modify" lambda if it was defined.
  APPLY # Applies colour on the VAL. Abstract, non-existent function.

  for colour in cond_formatting_colours:      # User + MultiQC colours.
    match = False
    for cmp in cond_formatting_rules[colour]: # User + MultiQC rules.
      try:
        # Each comparison should be a dict with single key: val
        if "s_eq" in cmp and str(cmp["s_eq"]).lower() == str(VAL).lower():
          match = True
        if "s_contains" in cmp and str(cmp["s_contains"]).lower() in str(VAL).lower():
          match = True
        if "s_ne" in cmp and str(cmp["s_ne"]).lower() != str(VAL).lower():
          match = True
        if "eq" in cmp and float(cmp["eq"]) == float(VAL): match = True
        if "ne" in cmp and float(cmp["ne"]) != float(VAL): match = True
        if "gt" in cmp and float(cmp["gt"]) <  float(VAL): match = True
        if "lt" in cmp and float(cmp["lt"]) >  float(VAL): match = True
      except:
        logger.warning("Not able to apply table conditional formatting")
    if match:
        APPLY(colour)

- Multiline strings are not used in "description" to guarantee that indents
  won't be included. Though browsers reduce such chains to just one space,
  it still feels safer to avoid them by concatenating single strings.


Ideas:

- "format" could be automatically updated depending on the input value.
  if int -> "{:,.0f}
  elif float -> "{:,.Nf}", where N is the number of after-point digits.
  else -> "{:,.1f}, which is default by the MultiQC.

- The problem with overlapping adjacent columns/rows, when column's
  title block is shorter than single value blocks below.
  There is a solution, which can automatically improve the appearance
  of html tables. After data/headers have been collected, a special
  function converts the column's value to string, concatenates with
  "suffix" if present and appends at least abs(maxlen(values) - len(title))
  "&nbsp;" entities. Simple, but does not solve the issue in general.
  Additional JS script could analyze tables' data and attributes(eg font)
  to decide how much extra padding space is needed to increase table's
  readability further to some extent.


Final notes:

- Most configs below are for demonstration purposes only.
  You can adapt them according to your personal taste/needs.

- You have the final word in defining settings.
  The code trusts you and does not check the chosen values.

    The DRAGEN v3.7 standard does not provide any info about consistency of coverage metrics.
    In practice two metrics can be inconsistent:
        PCT of region with coverage [ix, inf)
        PCT of region with coverage [ix, jx)

    Presumably some part of the DRAGEN tries to improve the appearance of content in csv files.
    The two mentioned metrics may have a different number of spaces inserted within them.
    Amount and insertion places seem to depend on the highest number of digits in ix and jx.
    So, for example:
        if max ix = jx = 100x   [100x: inf), [ 50x:100x)   then [  0x: inf),  [ 10x: inf)
                                                            and [  0x:  1x),  [ 10x: 15x)
    but if max ix = jx = 1500x  [1500x: inf),[1000x:1500x) then [   0x: inf), [  10x: inf)
                                                            and [   0x:   1x),[  10x:  15x)

    Using such versions of the same metric as keys would result in two columns instead of one.
    There is a possibility that an input folder contains a mixed data with different versions.

    Assumption: each metric may be inconsistent due to unknown reasons.
    Solution:   modify each metric.

    To not exaggerate the problem, only the most obvious possible issues are solved.
    If new metric-specific peculiarities arise, they can be added to the make_consistent_metric.

    The following functions are mainly used to create configurations for headers.

    Input:
    - metric_pattern_match, which stores the result of matching a metric.

    Output:
    A dictionary with keys:
    - obligatory  configs   dict with real/logical configs from the SINGLE_HEADER.
    - obligatory  configs2  if the second value is present or
                            in case when metric can not be recognized.
    - optional    region    if present in a metric and can be extracted easily.
                            Returning it is encouraged.
    - optional    warning   can be returned if metric could not be recognized.
                            It is used for logging. Returning it is encouraged.

    Please note: modify lambda/func must check for string input.

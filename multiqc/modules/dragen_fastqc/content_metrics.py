            between the different bases of a sequence run, so the lines in this plot should
            run parallel with each other. The relative amount of each base should reflect
            the overall amount of these bases in your genome, but in any case they should
            not be hugely imbalanced from each other._
            _It's worth noting that some types of library will always produce biased sequence
            composition, normally at the start of the read. Libraries produced by priming
            using random hexamers (including nearly all RNA-Seq libraries) and those which
            were fragmented using transposases inherit an intrinsic bias in the positions
            at which reads start. This bias does not concern an absolute sequence, but instead
            provides enrichement of a number of different K-mers at the 5' end of the reads.
            Whilst this is a true technical bias, it isn't something which can be corrected
            by trimming and in most cases doesn't seem to adversely affect the downstream
            analysis._

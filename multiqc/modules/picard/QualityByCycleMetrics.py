        This metric gives an overall snapshot of sequencing machine performance.
        For most types of sequencing data, the output is expected to show a slight
        reduction in overall base quality scores towards the end of each read.

        Spikes in quality within reads are not expected and may indicate that technical
        problems occurred during sequencing.

                **NOTE: Usually, MultiQC run time is fairly insignificant - in the order of seconds.
                Unless you are running MultiQC on many thousands of analysis files, optimising this process
                will have limited practical benefit.**

                MultiQC works by recursively looking through all files found in the analysis directories.
                After skipping any that are too big / binary file types etc, it uses the search patterns
                defined in `multiqc/utils/search_patterns.yaml`.
                These work by matching either file names or file contents. Generally speaking, matching
                filenames is super fast and matching file contents is slower.

                Please see the [MultiQC Documentation](https://multiqc.info/docs/#optimising-run-time)
                for information on how to optimise MultiQC to speed this process up.
                The plot below shows which search keys are running and how long each has taken to run in
                total. This should help to guide you to where optimisation is most worthwhile.

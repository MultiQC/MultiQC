            There are currently three main approaches to map reads to transcripts in an
            RNA-seq experiment: mapping reads to a reference genome to identify expressed
            transcripts that are annotated (and discover those that are unknown), mapping
            reads to a reference transcriptome, and <i>de novo</i> assembly of transcript
            sequences (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-016-0881-8"
            target="_blank">Conesa et al. 2016</a>).

            For RNA-seq QC analysis, QualiMap can be used to assess alignments produced by
            the first of these approaches. For input, it requires a GTF annotation file
            along with a reference genome, which can be used to reconstruct the exon
            structure of known transcripts. This allows mapped reads to be grouped by
            whether they originate in an exonic region (for QualiMap, this may include
            5&#8242; and 3&#8242; UTR regions as well as protein-coding exons), an intron,
            or an intergenic region (see the <a href="http://qualimap.bioinfo.cipf.es/doc_html/index.html"
            target="_blank">Qualimap 2 documentation</a>).

            The inferred genomic origins of RNA-seq reads are presented here as a bar graph
            showing either the number or percentage of mapped reads in each read dataset
            that have been assigned to each type of genomic region. This graph can be used
            to assess the proportion of useful reads in an RNA-seq experiment. That
            proportion can be reduced by the presence of intron sequences, especially if
            depletion of ribosomal RNA was used during sample preparation (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrg3642"
            target="_blank">Sims et al. 2014</a>). It can also be reduced by off-target
            transcripts, which are detected in greater numbers at the sequencing depths
            needed to detect poorly-expressed transcripts (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/gr.124321.111"

        For RNA-seq QC analysis, QualiMap can be used to assess alignments produced by
        the first of these approaches. For input, it requires a GTF annotation file
        along with a reference genome, which can be used to reconstruct the exon
        structure of known transcripts. QualiMap uses this information to calculate the
        depth of coverage along the length of each annotated transcript. For a set of
        reads mapped to a transcript, the depth of coverage at a given base position is
        the number of high-quality reads that map to the transcript at that position
        (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrg3642" target="_blank">Sims et al. 2014</a>).

        QualiMap calculates coverage depth at every base position of each annotated
        transcript. To enable meaningful comparison between transcripts, base positions
        are rescaled to relative positions expressed as percentage distance along each
        transcript (*0%, 1%, &#8230;, 99%*). For the set of transcripts with at least
        one mapped read, QualiMap plots the _cumulative mapped-read depth_ (y-axis) at
        each relative transcript position (x-axis). This plot shows the gene coverage
        profile across all mapped transcripts for each read dataset. It provides a
        visual way to assess positional biases, such as an accumulation of mapped reads
        at the 3&#8242; end of transcripts, which may indicate poor RNA quality in the
        original sample (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-016-0881-8"
        target="_blank">Conesa et al. 2016</a>).

        The _Normalised_ plot is calculated by MultiQC to enable comparison of samples
        with varying sequencing depth. The _cumulative mapped-read depth_ at each
        position across the averaged transcript position are divided by the total for
        that sample across the entire averaged transcript.

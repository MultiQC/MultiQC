 original
===========

The artist formerly known as "default", now renamed to be the OG: "original".

Note, this is where most of the MultiQC report interactive functionality
is based and will be developed. Unless you want to do some really radical
changes, you probably don't want to replace this theme. Instead, you can
create a child theme that starts with 'default' and then overwrites
certain files.

For more information about creating child themes, see the docs:
docs/templates.md

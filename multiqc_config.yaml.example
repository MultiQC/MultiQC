# Example MultiQC Configuration File
#######################################

# Note that this file can be saved either in the MultiQC installation
# directory, or as ~/.multiqc_config.yaml

# Configuration settings are taken from the following locations, in order:
# - Hardcoded in MultiQC (multiqc/utils/config.py)
# - <installation_dir>/multiqc_config.yaml
# - ~/.multiqc_config.yaml
# - Command line options

# Title to use for the report.
title: None

# Prepend sample names with their directory. Useful if analysing the
# sample samples with different parameters.
prepend_dirs: False

# Default output filenames
output_fn_name: multiqc_report.html
data_dir_name: multiqc_data

# Whether to create the parsed data directory in addition to the report
make_data_dir: True

# Cleaning options for sample names. Typically, sample names are detected
# from an input filename. If any of these strings are found, they and any
# text to their right will be discarded.
# For example - file1.fq.gz_trimmed.bam_deduplicated_fastqc.zip
# would be cleaned to 'file1'

# Ignore these files when searching for logs

# Ignore files larger than this when searcing for logs (bytes)
log_filesize_limit: 1000000

# Limit for datasets per plot in the report. If there are more than
# this, the user will need to click 'plot graph' to see the data.
# This is to prevent very large graphs from locking up the browser on load.
num_datasets_plot_limit: 50

# Overwrite module filename search patterns. See multiqc/utils/search_patterns.yaml
# for the defaults. Remove a default by setting it to None.

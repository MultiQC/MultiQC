:::

BUSCO v2 provides quantitative measures for the assessment of genome
assembly, gene set, and transcriptome completeness, based on
evolutionarily-informed expectations of gene content from near-universal
single-copy orthologs selected from OrthoDB v9.

The module parses the `short_summary_[samplename].txt` files and
plots the proportion of BUSCO types found. MultiQC has been tested with
output from BUSCO v1.22 - v2.
